<p class="drop-cap">FOUR roads in Sussex mark out a patch of country
that from the wooded, sea-viewing hills behind
Dallington slips down over fields and ponds
and spinneys to the marshes of Hailsham and Horse
Eye. The North Road, slatting the heights with its
pale, hard streak, runs from far Rye to further Lewes,
a road of adventures and distances, passing Woods
Corner and Three Cups Corner, Punnetts Town and
Cade Street, till it joins the London Road at Cross-in-Hand.
The South Road borders the marsh, sometimes
dry on the shelving ground above it, sometimes soggy
on the marsh level, or perhaps sheeted with the overflow
of the Hurst Haven. It comes from Senlac and
Hastings, and after skirting the flats, crosses the River
Cuckmere, and runs tamely into Lewes, where all roads
meet. The East Road is short and shaggy, running
through many woods, from the North Road, which
it joins at Woods Corner, to the throws at Boreham
Street. Along this road is a string of farms—Cowlease,
and Padgham, and Slivericks, mangy holdings
for the most part, with copses running wild and
fields of thistles, doors agape and walls atumble, and
gable-ends stooping towards the ponds. The West

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

Road is grass-grown, and in July St. John’s wort and
rest-harrow straggle in the ruts and make the dust
smell sickly-sweet. It forks from the North Road at
Punnetts Town, and runs through Rushlake Green and
the Foul Mile to Hailsham in the south.</p>

<p>In the swale of the day, towards Easter-time, the
Reverend Mr. Sumption was walking along the North
Road from Dallington to Woods Corner. Dallington is
the mother-parish of the country bounded by the Four
Roads, though there is also a church at Brownbread
Street, in charge of a curate. Mr. Sumption had no
truck with either Rector or curate, for he was a minister
of the Particular Baptists, who had a Bethel in
Sunday Street, as the lane was called which linked the
East Road with one that trailed in and out of farms
and woods to the throws at Bucksteep Manor. Not
that the sect of the Particular Baptists flourished in the
parish of Dallington, but the Bethel being midway between
the church and the chapel, a fair congregation
could be raked in on wet Sundays from the middle
district, where doctrine, like most things in that land
of farms, was swung by the weather.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Sumption was a big, handsome
man of forty-five, and wore a semi-clerical suit of
greenish-black, with a shabby hat and a dirty collar.
His face was brown, darkening round the jaw with a
beard that wanted the razor twice a day, but did not
get it. His eyes were dark and sunk deep in his head,
gleaming like deep ditch-water under eyebrows as
smooth and black as broom-pods. His teeth were very
white, and his hair was grey and curly like a fleece.</p>

<p>As he walked he muttered to himself, and from time
to time cracked the joints of his fingers with a loud
rapping sound. These two habits helped form the local
opinion that he was “queer,” an opinion bolstered by

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>

more evidence than is usual in such cases. Women
standing in their cottage doors noticed him twice halt
and stoop—once to pick up a beetle which was laboriously
crawling from ditch to ditch, another time to pick
up a swede dropped from some farm-cart. He carefully put
the beetle on the opposite bank—“Near squashed you,
my dear, I did. But He Who created the creeping things
upon the earth has preserved you from the boot
of man.” The swede he dusted and crammed in his
pocket. It was known throughout the hamlets—the
“Streets” and “Greens”—of Dallington Parish that
the minister was as poor as he was unblushing about
his poverty.</p>

<p>The evening was very still. Eddies and swells of
golden, watery light drifted over the hills round Dallington.
In the north the sharp, wooded hill where
Brightling stood was like a golden cone, and the kiln-shaped
obelisk by Lobden’s House which marked the
highest point of South-east Sussex was also burnished
to rare metal. The scent of water, stagnant on fallen
leaves, crept from the little woods where the primroses
and windflowers smothered old stumps in their pale
froth, or spattered with milky stars the young moss of
the year. At Woods Corner the smoke of a turf fire
was rising from the inn, and there was a smell of
beer, too, as the minister passed the door, and turned
down the East Road towards Slivericks. The fire and
the beer both tempted him, for there was neither at
the Horselunges, the tumble-down old cottage where
he lodged in Sunday Street. But the former he looked
on as an unmanly weakness, the latter as a snare of the
devil, so he swung on, humming a metrical psalm.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards below Woods Corner, just
where the road, washed stony by the rains, runs under
the webbing of Slivericks oaks, he turned into a field,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>

across which a footpath led a pale stripe towards Sunday
Street. From the top of the field he could look
down over the whole sweep of country within the Four
Roads, to the marshes and the sea, or rather the saffron
and purple mists where the marshes and the sea
lay together in enchantment. The yellow light wavered
up to him from the sunset, over the woods of Forges
and Harebeating; there was a sob of wind from Stilliands
Tower, and a gleam of half-hidden ponds in the
spinneys by Puddledock. Mr. Sumption stood still and
listened.</p>

<p>The air was full of sunset sounds—the lowing of
cows came up with a mingled cuckoo’s cry, there was
a tinkle of water behind him in the ditch, and the soft
swish of wind in the trees and in the hedge, nodding
ashes and sallows and oaks to and fro against the light-filled
sky. On the wind was a mutter and pulse, a
throb which seemed to be in it yet not of it, like the
beating of a great heart, strangely remote from all the
gleam and softness of spring sunset, pale fluttering
cuckoo-flowers, and leaf-sweet pools of rain. A blackbird
called from the copse by Cowlease Farm, and his
song was as the voice of sunset and April and pooled
rain ... still the great distant heart throbbed on, its
dim beats pulsing on the wind, aching on the sunset,
over the fields of peaceful England dropping asleep in
April.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Sumption cracked his fingers
loudly once or twice:</p>

<p>“You hear ’em pretty plain to-night ... the guns
in France.”</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>He walked slowly on towards the stile, then stopped
again and pulled a letter out of his pocket. It was a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>

dirty letter, written on cheap note-paper with a
smudged in indelible pencil.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Dear Father,” it ran, “I reckon you’ll be wild when
you get this. I have left the Fackory and have enlisted
in the R. Sussex Regement. I could not stand
that dirty tyke of Hubbard our forman any more. So
I’ve gone, for I’m sick of this, and there’s no fear of
my being fetched back, as I’m not satisfackory nor
skilled in particular, and should have been fetched out
anyhow all in good time, I reckon. So don’t go taking on
about this, but please send me some fags, and I should
like some chockolate, and get some of those kokernut buns
at the shop with the crinkly paper round. It is a week
since I did it, but I have been to the Y.M.C.A., and
bought some Cherry-blossom boot-pollish and a packet
of Players, and have no more money, and they said on
a board ‘Write home to-night.’ Well, dear Father, I
hope you will not take this too badly. Some good may
come of it, for I am a soldier now and going to fight the
Germans. Good-bye and don’t forget to send the things
I said.</p>

<p class="sig3">
“Your loving son,</p>
<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Jerry</span>.</p>
<p class="right">“(467572 Pvte. Sumption, 9th Co. 18th Bn. R. Suss.
Rejiment.)”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The minister crushed the letter back into the pocket
already bulging with the swede. “O Lord,” he groaned,
“why doth it please Thee to afflict Thy servant again?
I reckon I’ve stood a lot on account of that boy, and
there seems no end to it. He’s the prodigal son that
never comes home, he’s the lost sheep that never gets
into the fold, and yet he’s my child and the woman
from Ihornden’s....” His mutterings died down, for
he heard footsteps behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>A young man was crossing the field from Slivericks, a
sturdy, stocky fellow, about five-and-a-half feet high,
with leggings and corduroy riding-breeches, and a black
coat which was a little too small for him and as he drew
near sent out an odour of moth-killer—evidently some
young farmer, unaccountably Sundified on a week-day
evening.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Tom,” said the minister.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Mus’ Sumption.”</p>

<p>The boy stood aside for the older man to cross the
stile. His head hung a little over the unaccustomed
stiffness of his collar, and his eyes seemed full of rather
painful thought. Mr. Sumption fumbled in his pockets,
drew out the letter, the swede, a pencil without a point,
a Testament, a squashed mass of chickweed, a tract, and
finally a broken-backed cigarette, which he handed to
Tom.</p>

<p>“Bad news, I reckon?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>“They woan’t let me off. I wur afeard they wouldn’t.
You see, there’s faather and the boys left, and I couldn’t
explain as how faather had bad habits. You can’t bite
back lik that on your own kin.”</p>

<p>“No, you can’t,” and Mr. Sumption carefully
smoothed a dirty scrap of paper as he put it back in his
pocket. “By the way, my boy’s just joined up. I
heard from him this morning. He’s in the Eighteenth
Sussex—I shouldn’t wonder if you found yourselves
together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lord, Mus’ Sumption! You doan’t tell me as he’s
left the factory?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he has. Thought he’d like to fight for his
King and country. He was always a plucked ’un, and
he couldn’t bear to see the lads going to the front without
him.”</p>

<p>There was a gleam in the minister’s eyes, and he
cracked his fingers loudly.</p>

<p>“I’m proud of him—I’m proud of my boy. He’s done
a fine thing, for of course he need never have gone. He’s
been three years in munitions now, and him only twenty.
He went up to Erith when he was a mere lad, no call for
him to go, and now he’s joined up as a soldier when
there was no call for him to go, neither.”</p>

<p>Tom looked impressed.</p>

<p>“Maybe I ought to be feeling lik he does, but truth
to tell it maakes me heavy-hearted to be leaving the
farm just now.”</p>

<p>“The Lord will provide.”</p>

<p>“I’m none so sure o’ that, wud faather and his habits,
and the boys so young and wild, and the girls wud their
hearts in other things, and mother, poor soul, so unsensible.”</p>

<p>“Well, what does the farm matter? Beware lest it
become Naboth’s vineyard unto you. Is this a time to
buy cattle and vineyards and olive-yards? This is the
day which the Prophet said should burn like an oven, and
the proud, even the wicked, be as stubble. What’s
your wretched farm? Think of the farms round Ypers
and Dixmood, think of the farms round Rheims and
Arrass—Stop!” and he seized Tom’s arm in his hard,
restless fingers—“Listen to those guns over in France.
Perhaps every thud you hear means the end of a little
farm.”</p>

<p>Tom stood dejectedly beside him, the broken-backed
cigarette, for which the minister had unfortunately been
unable to provide a light, hanging drearily from his teeth.
The soft mutter and thud pulsed on. The sun was
slowly foundering behind the woods of Bird-in-Eye,
sending up great shafts and spines of flowery light into
the sky which was now green as a meadow after rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“This war queers me,” he said, and his voice, low and
thick as it was, like any Sussex countryman’s, yet was
enough to drown the beating of that alien heart. “I doan’t
understand it. I can’t git the hang od it nohow.”</p>

<p>“A lot of it queers me,” said Mr. Sumption, “and I
reckon that in many ways we’re all as godless as the
Hun. It’s not only the Germans that shall burn like
stubble—it’s us. The oven’s prepared for us as well as
for them.”</p>

<p>They were walking together down steep fields, the
ground dreamy with grey light, while before them, beyond
the sea, burned the great oven of the sunset, full
of horns of flame.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of the farm,” continued Tom, his mind
sticking to its first idea. “I’m willing enough to go and
fight for the farms in France and Belgium, but seems
to me a Sussex farm’s worth two furrin’ ones. Worge
aun’t a fine place, but it’s done well since I wur old
enough to help faather—help him wud my head as well
as my arms, I mean. Faather’s an unaccountable clever
chap—you should just about hear him talk at the pub,
and the books he’s read you’d never believe. But he’s
got ways wot aun’t good for farming, and he needs somebody
there to see as things doan’t slide when he can’t
look after them himself.”</p>

<p>“Can’t your brother Harry do anything? He must be
nearly sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Harry’s unaccountable wild-like. He’s more lik to
git us into trouble than help us at all.”</p>

<p>“Maybe your father will pull-to a bit when you’re
gone and he sees things depend on him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe he will, and maybe he woan’t. But you
doan’t understand, Mus’ Sumption. You doan’t know
wot it feels like to be took away from your work to help
along a war as you didn’t ask for and don’t see the hang
of. Maybe you’d think different of the war if you had
to fight in it, but being a minister of religion you aun’t
ever likely to have to join up. I’m ready to go and do
my share in putting chaps into the oven, as you say,
but it’s no use or sense your telling me as it doan’t
matter about the farm, for matter it does, and I’m unaccountable
vrothered wud it all.”</p>

<p>He grunted, and spat out the fag. Mr. Sumption,
taking offence at once, waved his arms like a black
windmill.</p>

<p>“Ho! I don’t understand, don’t I? with my only
son just gone for a soldier. D’you think you care for
your dirty farm more than I care for my Jerry. D’you
think I wouldn’t rather a hundred times go myself than
that he should go? O Lord, that this boy should mock
me! You’ll be safe enough, young Tom. You’ve only
the Germans to fear, but my lad has to fear his own
countrymen too. The army was not made for gipsy-women’s
sons. My poor Jerry! ... there in the ranks
like a colt in harness. He’ll be sorry he’s done it to-morrow,
and then they’ll kill him.... Oh, hold your
tongue, Tom Beatup! Here we are in Sunday Street.”</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Sunday Street was the lane that linked up Pont’s
Green on the East Road with Bucksteep Manor at Four
Throws. From the southern distance it looked like the
street of a town, oddly flung across the hill—a streak of
red houses, with the squat steeples of oasts, an illusion
of shops and spires, crumbling on near approach into a
few tumble-down cottages and the oasts of Egypt Farm.
From the north you saw the chimneys first, high above
the roofs like rabbits’ ears above their heads; then you
tumbled suddenly upon the hamlet: the Bethel, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>

Horselunges, the shop, the inn whose sign was the Rifle
Volunteer, the forge, the pond, the two farms—Worge
and Egypt—with their cottages, and the farmstead of
Little Worge sidling away towards Pont’s Green.</p>

<p>To-night it was fogged in the grey smoke of its own
wood fires, with here and there on its windows the
lemon green of the sky. It smelled faintly of wood-smoke,
sweet mud and standing rain, of rot in lathes
and tiles. The Horselunges, the cottage where the
minister lodged, was the first house in the village after
the forge. It stood opposite the Bethel, a brick, eighteenth-century
building with big gaunt windows staring
blindly over the fields to Puddledock. The Bethel had
been built in Georgian days when the Particular Baptists
flourished in greater numbers round Sunday Street,
and a saint of theirs had built it to “the glory of God
and in memory of my dear wife Susannah Odlarne,
saved by Grace. For Many are called but Few are
chosen.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption and Tom had walked the last of their
way in silence. But the minister’s anger had fizzled
out as quickly as it had kindled, and at the door of the
forge he held out his hand very kindly to the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, good-night to you, lad. I must look in and
see Bourner here for a minute or two. I hope your
mother won’t be much distressed at your news.”</p>

<p>“Reckon she will, but it can’t be helped.... Funny,
you doan’t hear the guns down here.”</p>

<p>“No more you do, but they’re going it just the same—knocking
away little farms.”</p>

<p>Tom nodded with a wry smile and walked off. The
minister turned into the forge.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption could never pass the forge, and the glow
and roar of sparks from its chimney would call him over
many a field, from Galleybird or Harebeating, or even

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>

from the doors of sick people—if they were not very sick.
He was a blacksmith’s son.</p>

<p>His father had worked the smithy at the cross-roads
by Bethersden in Kent, and Ezra Sumption had grown
up in the smell of hoof-parings and the ring of smitten
iron. His sketchy education finished, he had taken his
place beside his father at the anvil—he had held the
meek tasselled hoofs of the farm-horses, he had worked
the great bellows that sent the flames roaring up the
chimney like Judgment Day, he had swung the heavy
smith’s hammer with an arm that in a few years grew
lustier than his dad’s, and in time had come to cast as
good iron and clap it on as surely as any smith in Kent.</p>

<p>But during his adolescence strange things had grown
with his bulk and girth. Lonely and Bible-bred, he
came to work strange dreams into the roaring furnace
and clanging iron. In those sheeting, belching flames
he came to see the presage of that day which should
burn like an oven, the burning fiery furnace of Shadrach,
Meshach and Abed-nego, through which only
those could walk unsinged who had with them the Son
of God. When he swung the hammer above his head
he swung God’s judgment down on the molten iron,
shaping out of its fiery torment a form of use. When the
horse clumped out of the smithy with the new iron on
his hoofs, he felt that there went a soul saved, a child of
God passed through fire into service.</p>

<p>He became “queer.” He spoke his thoughts, and in
time preached them to the men who brought their horses
to be shod. His father jeered at him, his mother was
afraid, but the minister of a neighbouring chapel took
him up. He thought he had found a rustic saint. He
invited young Sumption to his house, taught him, and
encouraged him to enter the ministry. The parents were
flattered by the pastor’s notice, and he found little

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>

difficulty in persuading them to let their boy leave the forge
and train as a minister of the Particular Baptists.</p>

<p>Rather bewildered and scared at the new life before
him, young Ezra Sumption, comely, burly, shock-headed,
brown-skinned as a mushroom in a wet field, passed into
a training college of the sect, and emerged a full-blown
pastor, with black clothes on his unwieldy limbs and a
tongue for ever struggling with the niceties of English
speech. He was a great disappointment to his benefactor,
for the smith in him had triumphantly survived all genteel
training and theological examinations; he was to
all intents the same boy who had heard voices in the fire
and had preached to the carters. His manners and conversation
had slightly improved, and his imaginings had
been given a dose of dogma, but his rough uncouthness,
his “queerness” remained as before. He was an utter
failure as assistant pastor in a chapel at Dover—the congregation
was shocked by the violence and vulgarity of
his forge-born similes, his Judgment Day appeals, all the
spate and fume of the old Doomsday doctrines which
were fast dying out of Nonconformity. He pined for the
country, and seemed unable to conform to town habits.
On his holidays he went back to the forge and helped his
father with the shoeing as if he had never worn a black
coat. It was on one of these holidays that he finally
damned himself.</p>

<p>In a cottage at Ihornden where he had gone to visit a
sick woman he met a gipsy girl of the Rossarmescroes or
Hearns. Her people had given up their wandering life,
and settled down in the neighbourhood, where they
owned several cottages. Nevertheless, to marry her, as
Sumption did soon after their third meeting, was his
pastoral suicide. He took her with him to Dover, where
they were both miserable for a few months. Then he
had to give up his post. They returned to the forge at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>

Bethersden, where Sumption would have liked to become
a blacksmith again, if it had not been for the continual
restless yearning of the Word within him, that
drop of the divine which had somehow mixed with his
clay, and made him drunken.</p>

<p>At the close of the year Meridian Sumption died at
the birth of her child. They had been ideally happy in
their short married life, in spite of the cage-bars of circumstances
and the drivings of the Word which divided
them as in the beginning it had divided the waters from
the earth. After her death he became “queerer” than
ever. He roamed from village to village, preaching to
farmers, gipsies, labourers, tinkers, all who would hear
him and some who would not—leaving his child in his
mother’s care.</p>

<p>Six years later the death of his father and mother
made it necessary that he should take the boy—named
grotesquely Jeremiah Meridian, as if to show his double
origin in religion and vagabondage. At the same time
his first patron, the minister of Bethersden, offered to
recommend him for the pastorate of the Particular Baptist
Chapel at Sunday Street near Dallington. His conscience
had long grieved over the vagaries of his blacksmith
saint, and in this empty pastorate he saw a way of
settling both. Sumption had acquired a certain fame as
a preacher among the ’dens of Kent, candidates for the
Particular Ministry were not so many as they used to be,
and the pastorate of Sunday Street, with its dwindling,
bumpkin congregation, country loneliness, and small
revenues, was hard to fill. After various difficulties, the
new minister arrived with his black-eyed, swarthy child.
He had grown tired of his wanderings, and had conceived
an erratic, arbitrary affection for this pledge of
gipsy love. He looked forward to a settled country life
and to preaching the Word in his own Bethel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The villagers, for the most part, liked him. His
manners offended them, and as they were mostly Church-people
they seldom came to his chapel except on wet
Sundays, when it meant too much dirt and trouble to go
to hear old Mr. Foxe at Dallington or young Mr. Poullett-Smith
at Brownbread Street. But from the first he
was as one of themselves, treated with no respect and
much kindness. He was seldom invited to sick-beds or to
officiate at funerals or marriages, but he never lacked an
invitation to a Harvest Supper or Farmers’ Club Dinner.
For his sake the neighbourhood tolerated the villainies
of his Jerry, a throw-back to the poaching, roving, thieving
Rossarmescroes. None the less, they were glad when
at the outbreak of war he went to work in a munition
factory, first in London, then, through a series of not very
creditable wanderings, to Erith. Only the minister
grieved, for he loved Jerry as he had loved no human
thing since his mother died in the little apple-smelling
room above the smithy. He was not always kind to the
boy, and the arm which had wielded the hammer so
lustily had on one or two shocking occasions nearly
broken the bones he loved. But he had for his son a
half-spiritual, half-animal affection, and the villagers
pitied him when the boy went, though they were glad to
see him go.</p>

<p>“Mus’ Sumption wur more blacksmith nor he wur
minister,” they said when any local enthusiasm for him
prevailed; and it was true that in his loneliness and
anxiety he would often find comfort in the forge at Sunday
Street, where he could sit and watch Bourner the
smith swing his hammer, or even sometimes himself, with
coat thrown off and shirt-sleeves rolled back over arms
long and hairy as a gorilla’s, smite the hot iron or scrape
the patient hoof, while his face grew red as copper in the
firelight and the sweat ran over it and his shaggy chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>To-night, when Jerry had wounded him afresh, he
turned to his unfailing refuge. His pain was not the
mere dread of death or maiming of the lad—it was something
more sinister, more intangible. “The army is not
for the gipsy woman’s son.” He feared for Jerry in that
organised system of rank and order and command. He
would have preferred him in the workshop even if the
relative danger of the two places had been reversed.
Jerry was less likely to be smashed by a German shell
than by the system in which he had enrolled himself.
He would break his head against its discipline, hang himself
in its rules.... His dread for Jerry under martial
law was the dread his Meridian’s ancestors would have
felt for her under a roof. It was a fear based more on
instinct than on reason, therefore all the more bruising
to the instinctive passion of fatherhood. It was well
that he had this refuge of iron and anvil, of hammer and
hoof, this small comforting similitude of the day which
should burn as an oven.... Bourner the smith did not
talk to him much. He made a few technical remarks,
and winked at his mate when Mr. Sumption boasted of
Jerry’s valour in joining the army. But gradually the
tired, careworn look on the minister’s face died away,
his eyes ceased to smoulder and roll; in the thick stuffy
atmosphere, strong with the smell of hoofs and the ammoniacal
smell of hide and horses, grey with smoke and
noisy with the roar of flames and the ring of iron, he was
going back in peace to his father’s house, to the smithy
at the throws by Bethersden, before the burdens of divine
and human love had come down upon him.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>After his companion had left him, Tom Beatup walked
quickly down the lane, past the Horselunges and the Rifle

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

Volunteer, to where Worge gate hung crooked across
Worge drive, paintless and smeared with dew. Here he
stopped a minute, and looked at the huddle of the farm.
It was one black shape against the yellow of the sky, and
the cones of its oasts and the spires of its poplars seemed
part of its block, so that it looked grotesque and horned.
He hesitated, rubbed his hand along the top of the gate
and licked the dew off his fingers, then turned and walked
eastward.</p>

<p>Beyond Egypt Farm and the cottages of Worge, just
before the willow pond that marked the end of the street,
stood the shop, where Thyrza Honey was “licensed to
sell tobacco.” It was in darkness now, except for a faint
creep of light under the door. Had Thyrza “shut up”?
No—the handle turned, the little bell gave its buzzing
ring, and the warm light ran out for a moment into the
darkling lane—with a smell of tea and tobacco, sweets
and sawdust, scrubbed floor and rotting beams, the smell
that was to Tom the same refuge as the smell of the forge
was to Mr. Sumption.</p>

<p>The shop was empty, but he could see a shadow moving
to and fro across the little window at the back—a
ridiculous little window, about a foot square, yet as gay
with its lace curtains and pink ribbons as the drawing-room
bow of a Brighton lodging-house. The next minute
a face was pressed against it, then withdrawn, and the
door at the back of the shop opened.</p>

<p>“Good evenun, Mus’ Tom.”</p>

<p>“Good evenun, Mrs. Honey.”</p>

<p>She moved slowly to her place behind the counter. All
her movements were slow, which women sometimes found
irritating, but never men, who were always either consciously
or unconsciously aware of a kind of drawling
beauty in her gait. She was fair, with hair like fluffy,
sun-bleached grass. Her skin was like that of an apricot,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

soft and thick, of a deep creamy yellow, with soft dabs
of colour on her wide cheek-bones.</p>

<p>“A packet of woodbines, please,” said Tom.</p>

<p>She reached them from the shelf behind her.</p>

<p>“Have you got any bull’s-eyes?”</p>

<p>“Yes—three-ha’pence an ounce.”</p>

<p>“They’ve got dearer.”</p>

<p>“And they’ll get dearer still, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Give me three penn’orth, please.”</p>

<p>She took them out of a glass bottle at her elbow.</p>

<p>“Got any monster telephones?”</p>

<p>“I dunno—I’m afeard we’re sold out.”</p>

<p>Thyrza always spoke of herself in a business capacity
as “we.”

“Could you maake up two penn’orth? Harry and
Zacky are unaccountable fond of them.”</p>

<p>“You’re a kind brother—buying sweeties for all
the family. I reckon the bull’s-eyes are fur your
sisters.”</p>

<p>“Reckon they are. No use giving monster telephones
to girls—they can’t be eaten dentical.”</p>

<p>This was obvious when Thyrza finally unearthed the
telephones in an old case under the ginger-beer box.
They were long, black coiling strings of liquorice, requiring
sleight of hand, combined with a certain amount
of unfastidiousness, for their consumption. Tom was
disappointed that Thyrza had found them so soon. He
stood by the counter, fingering his purchases and wishing
his money was not all gone.</p>

<p>“I hear you’ve bin up at the Tribunal,” said Thyrza,
coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Yes—they woan’t let me off.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re sorry, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Unaccountable. I doan’t know wot ull become of
the farm.”</p>

<p>Thyrza sighed sympathetically, having nothing to say
in the way of comfort.</p>

<p>“They said as how I wurn’t really indispensable,
faather being able-bodied and having two lads besides
me, and two ‘hands’”—he laughed bitterly. “I’d like to
show ’em the ‘hands’—two scarecrows, you might say.”</p>

<p>“It’s a sad world,” remarked Thyrza comfortably.</p>

<p>Mrs. Honey was a widow, but never had more than a
sentimental sigh for her husband who had made her
miserable, and then suddenly rather proud—on that last
day of October when the Royal Sussex had held the road
to Sussex against the fury of the Prussian Guard, and
Sam Honey died to save the home he had made so unhappy
while he lived. He had died bravely and she was
proud of him, but he had lived meanly and she could not
regret him.</p>

<p>“Wot sort of a soldier d’you think I’ll make, Mrs.
Honey?”</p>

<p>“A good one, surelye”—and she showed him teeth
like curd.</p>

<p>“I’m naun so sure, though. I’m a farmer bred, and
the life ull be middling strange to me.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll lik it. Sam liked it fine. There was
no end o’ fun to be had, he said, and foakes all giving you
chocolate and woodbines, just as if you wur the king.”</p>

<p>“Will you send me a postcard now and agaun, Mrs.
Honey?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I will.”</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute or two in the shop.
The oil lamp swung, moving the shadows over the ceiling
where the beams sagged with the weight of Thyrza’s
little bedroom. A clock in the back room ticked loudly.
Tom was still leaning across the counter, looking at
Thyrza. They both felt rather awkward, as they often
felt in each other’s company. Thyrza wondered when

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>

Tom was going. She liked him—liked him unaccountable—but
her bit of supper was on the fire in the next
room, there was some mending to be done, and many
other odds and ends of feminine business before it was
time to set the mouse-traps, put the milk-jug on the
doorstep, and go to bed. Besides, she knew he ought to
be going back to Worge to tell his family the news which
should have been theirs before he brought it to her.</p>

<p>“I reckon your mother ull be wondering how you’ve
fared this afternoon. Has your father gone home and
told her?”</p>

<p>“I left faather at Woods Corner.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be worriting about him too, then.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I should ought to go home and tell them.”</p>

<p>He straightened himself with a sigh. He must leave
his refuge of tea and soap and candles, the peace of
Thyrza Honey’s slow movements and thick, sweet voice.
She was sorry for him.</p>

<p>“You’ll look in again, Mus’ Tom?”</p>

<p>“Surelye.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll bring your sister Ivy round for a cup
of tea before you go. Ull you be going soon?”</p>

<p>“In a fortnight.... Good evenun, Mrs. Honey.”</p>

<p>“Good evenun, Mus’ Tom.”</p>

<p>Again the bell gave its buzzing ring, as he opened the
door and went out.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Tom’s heart had sunk rather low before he came to
Worge. He was always dissatisfied with himself after
seeing Thryza. He never seemed able to find anything
to say, just because she was the person he liked most in
the world to talk to. He felt that he must be very

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>

different from the other men who came to see her—for
men liked Thyrza—who could make even the buying of
a penn’orth of sweets an occasion for artful sally and
interesting conversation. That reminded him that he
had left all his purchases on the counter. What an unaccountable
fool he was! However, he would not go
back for them. They must wait till to-morrow. Still,
he wished he hadn’t left them. Thyrza would think him
silly, and besides he had wanted to give those sweets to
his brothers and sisters. He nearly always brought
them something when he went into the town.</p>

<p>They were all at supper in the kitchen—he could hear
their voices. He wondered if his father had come back
yet. He had not, for the first question that greeted his
entrance was:</p>

<p>“Whur’s your faather, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I left him at Woods Corner. I’d have thought he’d
bin home by now.”</p>

<p>“Then you thought silly. ’T’aun’t likely as he’ll come
home till they close. You should have stopped along
of un.”</p>

<p>“I thought I’d better git back home and tell you the
news.”</p>

<p>“And wot’s that? Have they let you off?”</p>

<p>“Not they. A fortnight’s final.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup began to cry. She was a large, stout
woman with masses of rough grey hair, and a broad,
rather childish face, which now looked more like a child’s
than ever as it wrinkled up for crying.</p>

<p>“Now, mother, doan’t you taake on,” said Ivy, the
eldest girl, getting up and putting her arm round her.</p>

<p>“It’s a shaame, a hemmed shaame,” sobbed the
woman.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>

“No woander as faather’s stopped at Woods
Corner. To take our eldest boy as is the prop and stay
of the whole of us!”</p>

<p>“He aun’t no such thing,” said Ivy, who was a strapping
girl—rather like her mother, except that her round
face ended in a sharp chin, which gave her an unexpected
air of shrewdness. The second girl, Nell, was
helping her brother to his supper of pork and cabbage.</p>

<p>“No one can say he’s indispensable,” she remarked
in rather a pretty, half-educated voice—she was pupil
teacher in her second year at the school in Brownbread
Street. “There’s Harry just on sixteen, and there’s
Juglery and Elphick, and no one can say father isn’t a
strong man and able to look after the farm.”</p>

<p>“Your faather’s no use. Tom, did you tell them as
your faather had bad habits?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” said Tom sulkily, shovelling in the
cabbage with his knife.</p>

<p>“Then you wur a fool. You know as your faather
aun’t himself three nights out of five, and yet you go
and say naun about it. How are they to know if you
doan’t tell them?”</p>

<p>“I wurn’t going to tell all the big folk round Senlac as
my faather drinks.”</p>

<p>“Hush, Tom! I never said as you wur to say that—but
you might have let ’em know, careful like, as he
aun’t always able to look after the farm as well as you
might think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“It ud have done no good. Drunkenness aun’t a reason
for exemption, as they say. Besides, I’d middling little
to do in the matter. Faather was applying fur me, and
he did all the talking—an unaccountable lot of it, too. I
wurn’t took because there wurn’t enough said against
it, I promise you. But seemingly before a farm chap
like me gits off, he’s got to have a certifickit from the
War Agricultural Committee, and they read a letter saying
as they’d recommended one to be given, but the
Executive Committee or summat hadn’t fallen in wud
it. So there’s no use crying, mother, for go I must, and
it’ll be none the easier for you making all this vrother.”</p>

<p>He was cross because he was unhappy.</p>

<p>“Will you be in the Royal Sussex, Tom—along of
Mus’ Dixon and Mus’ Archie?” asked Zacky, the youngest
boy.</p>

<p>“I dunno.”</p>

<p>“When ull you be leaving?”</p>

<p>“In a fortnight, I’ve told you.”</p>

<p>“I hear as how Bill Putland ull be going soon,” said
Mrs. Beatup. “He’d be company like fur you, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Bill!—he’s too unaccountable fine and grand fur me.
He thinks no end of himself being Mus’ Lamb’s chuvver.
But I’ll tell you who’s joined the Sussex, though, and
that’s Jerry Sumption. I met Mus’ Sumption, this
evenun, and he toald me.”</p>

<p>“You doan’t mean to say as Jerry’s left the fackory?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He went and enlisted—minister says he’s unaccountable
proud of him.”</p>

<p>There was a crackle of laughter round the table.</p>

<p>“Well, we all of us know, and I reckon minister knows
as we know, that if Jerry had bin any sort of use at the
munititions they wouldn’t have let him join up. It’s a
law that if you maake munititions you doan’t have to
join up.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jerry’s bin never no good at naun. He’s jest a
roving gipsy dog.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup turned suddenly to Ivy:</p>

<p>“Did you know aught of this?”</p>

<p>“Not I!” said Ivy carelessly. “Jerry hasn’t written
to me fur more’n a month. Maybe this is why.”</p>

<p>“I’m justabout sorry fur Mus’ Sumption,” said Tom,
whom his supper had put in better humour.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>

“He has a feeling as Jerry ull come to no good in the
army.”</p>

<p>“No more he will, nor nowhere, I’m thinking,” said
Mrs. Beatup. “Doan’t you never have naun to do wud
him, Tom. I doan’t want my children to git the splash
of that gipsy muck——” And she threw another half-defiant,
half-furtive look at Ivy.</p>

<p>“Where’s Harry?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Out ratting,” Zacky informed him.</p>

<p>“Well, he woan’t find any supper’s bin kept fur him,
that’s all,” said Mrs. Beatup, rising and pushing back
her chair. “Nell, put the plaates on the tray and maake
yourself useful fur wunst.”</p>

<p>A flush crept over Nell’s pale, pretty face, from her
neck to the roots of her reddish hair. She gingerly
picked up two of the smelly, greasy plates, then quickly
put them down again.</p>

<p>“There’s faather.”</p>

<p>“Where?” Mrs. Beatup listened.</p>

<p>“I heard the gate—and there goes the side door.”</p>

<p>The next minute a heavy, uncertain footstep was
heard in the passage, then a bump as if someone had
lurched into the wall. The family stood stock-still and
waited.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll hurt himself in the dark,” said Mrs.
Beatup, “now policeman woan’t let us have the light at
the passage bend.”</p>

<p>“No, he’s all right. There he is scrabbling at the
door.”</p>

<p>There was the sound of fingers groping and scratching.
Then the door opened and the farmer of Worge came in,
his hat a little on one side, a lock of hair falling over his
red forehead, and the whole of his waistcoat undone.
He stood, supporting himself against the doorpost, and
glared at the family.</p>

<p>“Your supper’s still hot, Ned,” said Mrs. Beatup
hesitatingly—“leastways, the gals have eaten all the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>

taters, but I can hot you up....” She began to whimper
as the bleared grey eyes slowly rolled towards her.</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Mother,” said Ivy.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup, slowly and carefully, made his way
towards a broken-springed armchair beside the fire. He then
sat down by the simple process of falling into it
backwards; then he stretched out a foot that seemed
made of clay and manure——</p>

<p>“Taake off my boots, Missus.”</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>It was quite dark before Tom was able to slip out to
see to one or two odd jobs that wanted doing in the
barns. He felt himself obliged to stay in the kitchen
while his father was there, for though there had not been
more than a few occasions when surliness had blazed
into assault, he knew that it was always just possible
that his father might become violent, especially as his
mother always went the worst way—with tears, reproaches,
arguments and lamentations. What would
happen when he was no longer at hand to watch over her
he did not like to think. It was all part of the load of
anxiety and love which was settling down on him.</p>

<p>If he had been a free man he would probably have
felt quite ready for the change ahead of him. Though
his imagination had scarcely taken hold of the war, and
though the harrow and the plough, with the thick sucking
earth on his boots, and the drip of rain or stew of
sunshine on waiting fields, had absorbed most of the
boyish spirit of adventure which might have sent him
questing out of stuffier circumstances—though his was
the country heart, which is the last heart for warfare—in
spite of all, he might have gone gaily to the new life,
with its wider reach and freedom, if he had not known

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>

that his departure meant the crumbling of that little
corner of England which was his, which his arm had
built and his back supported.</p>

<p>He knew that Worge leaned on him, for he felt the
weight of it even in his dreams. It was four years now
since he had put his shoulder against it; he was only
just twenty, but he knew that if four years ago he had
not made up his mind to save the farm, his father would
have drunk, and the rest of the family muddled, the
place into the auction market, and the Beatups would
now be scattered into towns or soaking their humble-pie
in beer on smallholdings. He had done nothing very
wonderful. The place was small and no more wanted a
giant to hold it up than a giant to knock it down. He
had merely worked while others slacked, thought while
others slept, remembered while others forgot. But, without
any thrill of pride or adventure, he knew that he had
tided Worge through its bad hour, and that the same
little upheld it now. He was the real farmer, though he
had to be careful not to let his headship be seen. His
father had not explained things clearly to the tribunal—explaining
things clearly was not a quality of Tom’s
either—he had been far too anxious to preserve his own
importance, which might have suffered had he said, “My
son runs the farm while I’m drinking at the pub.”</p>

<p>The others were not even as much good as his father.
In the intervals of drinking, which in spite of Mrs.
Beatup’s three-in-five calculation were often quite respectable,
he was both hard-working and resourceful,
though of late his brain had grown spongier and threatened
a final rot. But the rest of the family had no upstanding
moments. Ivy was strong and comparatively
willing, but Tom did not believe in girls as farm-hands
and never thought of Ivy even milking the cows. She
and her mother looked after the chickens and did the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>

housework, that was all. Nell was out all day and busy
working in the evenings for her examination; Zacky was
still at school, and Harry was a rover—the comrade of
other farmers’ younger sons in ratting and sparrow-hunting,
in visiting fairs, in trespassing for birds’ eggs,
or sometimes solitary in strange obedience to the call of
distant wood or village green. Yet Harry was Tom’s one
hope—a last, forlorn one.</p>

<p>Tom was waiting for him now. He wanted to speak
to his young brother alone, not in the dim lath-smelling
bedroom where Zacky would be a third. Harry did not
generally stop out late, though he had occasionally
roamed all night—hunger and fear of a beating (another
of Tom’s quasi-paternal tasks) usually brought him home
just in time to satisfy one and escape the other.</p>

<p>Tom looked into the cowshed—one of the cows had
shown ailing signs that day, but she seemed well enough
now, with her large head lolling against the stall, her
eyes soft and untroubled in the brown glow of his lantern.
He would not see the calf which had caused him so much
half-proud anxiety; he wondered what would become
of them both if it should be born on one of Father’s
“bad nights.” Then he went into the stable, where the
three farm-horses—the sorrel, the brown, and the bay—stood
stamping and chumbling, with the cold miasmic
air like a mist above the straw. Then he went back into
the yard—saw that the hen-house door was fast, that old
Nimrod the watch-dog had his bone and his water and a
good length of chain. It was very cold, there was a faint
smell of rime on the motionless air, and the stars were
like spluttering candles in the frost-black sky. These
April days and nights were unaccountable tricky, he told
himself. That noon the very heart of the manure-heap
had melted in the sun, and now it was hardening again—his
boot hardly sank into the stuff as he trod it with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>

his heel. Some of it ought to be carted to-morrow and
put round the apple-trees....</p>

<p>Harry was very late. He would go into the corn-chamber
and do some accounts. He was clumsy with his
figures, and they kept him there twisting and scratching
his head till nearly ten o’clock, when he heard a footfall,
would-be stealthy, on the stones.</p>

<p>He rose quickly and ran round the yard to the backdoor
just as a shadow melted up against it.</p>

<p>“Here—you!” cried Tom surlily, for he was tired and
muddled with his sums—“doan’t you think to go slithering
in quiet lik that, you good-fur-naun.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come in when I like,” grumbled Harry. “You
aun’t maaster here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m the bigger chap, anyways, so mind your
manners. Where’ve you bin?”</p>

<p>“Only down to Puddledock.”</p>

<p>“Puddledock aun’t sich a valiant plaace as you shud
spend half a day there. You’ve bin up to no good, I
reckon. A fine chap you’ll be to mind Worge when I’m
gone.”</p>

<p>“You’re going, then?”</p>

<p>Harry’s voice was anxious, for he was fond of Tom,
though he resented his interference with his liberties.</p>

<p>“Yes—I’m going ... join up in a fortnight. Come
in, Harry; I want to spik to you.”</p>

<p>“I want my supper.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have your supper, though you doan’t desarve
it, you spannelling beggar. I’ll come and sit along of
you; we must talk business, you and I.”</p>

<p>“About Worge?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>They were in the kitchen now, dark except for some
gleeds of fire. The rest of the family had gone to bed,
but the broken supper was still on the table—the hacked,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>

hardening loaf, and the remains of the bacon and cabbage
under floating scabs of grease. Tom lit the lamp
and Harry sat down, hungry and uncritical. The two
boys were curiously alike, short and sturdy, with broad
sunburnt faces, grey eyes, big mouths, and small, defiant
noses. Harry’s coat was covered with clay all down one
side, and the sleeve was torn—Tom was too heavy-hearted
for more scolding, just noted drearily a new item
of expenditure. The younger brother saw the elder’s
cast-down looks:</p>

<p>“I’m unaccountable sorry, Tom,” he said sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Cos of wot? Cos I’m going or cos you aun’t worth
your bed and keep?”</p>

<p>“Cos of both.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s naun to do about one, but a sight to do
about t’other. Harry, you’ll have to mind Worge when
I’m agone.”</p>

<p>“Wot can I do?”</p>

<p>“You can work instead of roaming, and you can see
to things when faather’s bad—see as there aun’t naun
foolish done or jobs disremembered. Elphick and Juglery
have only half a head between them. Before I go
I’ll tell you all I’ve had in my head about the hay in
Bucksteep field, and the oats agaunst the Street and
them fuggles down by the Sunk. And you’ll have to
kip it all in your head saum as I’ve kipped it in mine,
and see as things come out straight by harvest. D’you
understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Tom.”</p>

<p>“And there’s Maudie’s calf due next month, and a
brood of them Orpingtons, and I’d meant to buy a boar
at Lewes Fair and kip him for service. You’ll never
have the sense to do it. You mun stop your ratting and
your roving, or Worge ull be at the auctioneer’s.
Faather’s a valiant clever chap when he’s sober, and
book-larned too, but the men are two old turnup-heads,
and Zacky’s scarce more’n a child, and the gals are gals—so
it’s up to you, Harry, as they say, to kip the plaace
going.”</p>

<p>Harry groaned——</p>

<p>“Why wudn’t they let you stay?”</p>

<p>“Because they didn’t see no sense in kipping an a
man on farm-work when there wur plenty about to do
his job. They doan’t understand how things are, and
when you coame to think of it, it’s a shaum as I can’t
go wud a free heart.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I aun’t got the chance of knowing, wud
all this vrothering me. But I’d go easier if I cud think
the plaace wouldn’t fall to pieces as soon as I left it, and
that if I’m killed....”</p>

<p>He stopped. Strangely enough, he had never thought
of being killed till now.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Tom’s calling-up papers did not arrive till a few days
later. It was a showery morning, with a flooding blue
sky, smeethed and streaked with low floats of cloud.
The rain was cracking on the little green panes of the
kitchen window, and the spatter of the drops, with the
soft humming song of the kitchen fire, was in Tom’s
ears as he studied the sheet which entitled one horse,
one bicycle, one mule, one (asterisked) private soldier
to travel cost-free to Lewes. He opened his mouth to
say, “My calling-up papers have come,” but said nothing,
just sat with his mouth open. The shower rattled
and the fire hummed, then a sudden spill of sunshine
came from the dripping edge of a cloud into the room,
making the drops on the pane like golden beads, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>

lighting up the breakfast table, so that the mangled loaf and
the dirty cups became almost as wonderful as the shining
faces round them.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup was himself this morning—they still
called it “himself,” though of late his real self had
seemed more and more removed from the lusty headacheless
man who sat among them to-day, more and
more closely coiled with that abject thing of sickness
and violence which came lurching down the fields at
dusk from the Rifle Volunteer. He was studying his
share of the post—an invitation to an auction at Rushlake
Green, where Galleybird Farm was up for sale with
all its live and dead stock. Mrs. Beatup had never had
a letter in her life, nor apparently wanted one. She
always exclaimed at the post, and wondered why Ivy
should have all those postcards. In her young days no
one sent postcards to girls. If a chap wanted you for
wife he hung around the gate, if he did not want you
for wife he took no manner of notice of you. A dozen
chaps could not want Ivy for wife—her with as many
freckles as a foxglove, and all blowsy too, and sunburnt
as a stack—and yet there were nearly a dozen postcards
strewn round her plate this morning. Some were field
postcards, whizz-bangs, from Sussex chaps in France,
some were stamped with the red triangle of the Y.M.C.A.,
some were views of furrin Midland places where Sussex
chaps were in training, and some were funny ones that
made Ivy throw herself back in her chair, and show her
big, white, friendly teeth, and laugh “Ha! ha!” till the
others said, “Let’s see, Ivy,” and the picture of the
Soldier come home on leave to find twins, or the donkey
chewing the Highlander’s kilt, or the Kaiser hiding in a
barrel from “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ach Gott! die</i> Royal Sussex!” would be
passed round the table. To-day one of the pictures of
the gentleman with twins—it was a popular one in the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>

Sussex, and Ivy had two this morning—was from Jerry
Sumption.</p>

<p>“Says he’s fed up,” said Ivy. “He reckons I knew
about his joining. How was I to know? He’s at Waterheel
Camp; and he’s met Sid Viner and young Kadwell.
They kip those boys far enough from home.”</p>

<p>“And a good thing too,” said Mrs. Beatup. “We
doan’t want Minister’s gipsy spannelling round.”</p>

<p>“Spik for yourself, mother—there aun’t a lad at
Waterheel as I wuldn’t have here if I cud git him.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come to no good,” grumbled her father, and
pretty Nell, with her anæmic flush, shrugged away from
her sister’s sprawling elbow. She herself had had only
one postcard, which she slipped hastily into the front of
her blouse—unlike Ivy, who left hers scattered over the
table even when the family had risen from their meal.
There was not much in the postcard to justify such
preferential treatment, for it ran—“There will be a
meeting of the Sunday-school teachers to-morrow in
church at 5.30. H. Poullett-Smith.”</p>

<p>Nell began to collect her books for school. She carefully
dusted the crumbs from her skirt, smoothed her
pretty marigold hair before the bit of mirror by the fireplace,
put on her hat and jacket, and was gone. The
rest of the family began to disperse. Zacky had to go to
school too, but his going was an unwilling, complicated
matter compared with Nell’s. His mother had to find
his cap, his sister to mend his bootlace, his father to cuff
his head, and finally his brother Tom to set him marching
with a kick in his rear.</p>

<p>Ivy tied on a sacking apron and began to slop soapsuds
on the floor of the outer kitchen, Mrs. Beatup set
out on a quest—which experience told would last the
morning—after a plate of potatoes she could have sworn
she had set in the larder overnight. Mus’ Beatup went off

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>

to his fields with Harry at his tail, and calling to Tom—</p>

<p>“Have you bin over to Egypt about them roots?”</p>

<p>“No—I’m going this mornun.”</p>

<p>“Then you can tell Putland as it’s taake or leave—he
pays my price or he doan’t have my wurzels.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father.”</p>

<p>Tom went off very quietly, fingering the summons in
his pocket. How many times now would he go on these
errands to Egypt, Cowlease, Slivericks and other farms?
His father would have to go, or if unfit, then Harry
would be sent—Harry who would sell you a cart of
swedes for tuppence or exchange a prize pig for a ferret.
That was an unaccountable queer little bit of paper in
his pocket. He could tear it in two, but it could also
do the same for him, and in any conflict it must come
out winner. It was, as it were, a finger of that invisible
hand which was being thrust down through the
clouds to grab Tom and other little people. The huge,
unseen, unlimited, unmerciful force of a kingdom’s
power lay behind it, and Tom’s single body and soul
must obey without hope of escape the great Manhood
that demanded them both, as a potter demands clay
and scoops up the helpless earth to bake in his oven....</p>

<p>All this in a more or less rag-and-tag state was passing
through his mind as he walked down the drive of Worge,
with Speedwell a-bloom between the ruts, and came to
the Inn whose painted sign was a volunteer of Queen
Victoria’s day. It was an old house, with a huge windward
sprawl of roof, but had not been licensed more than
sixty years. Tom disliked it as a temptation which
Providence had tactlessly dumped at their door. If
Mus’ Beatup had had to walk to the Crown at Woods
Corner or the George at Brownbread Street he would
have been more continuously the smart, upstanding man
he was this morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Egypt Farm was just across the road. It was smaller
than Worge, but also brighter and more prosperous-looking.
There was new white paint round the windows
and on the cowls of the oasts, and the little patch of
garden by the door was trim, with hyacinths a-blowing
and early roses spotting the trellis with their first buds.</p>

<p>“Mornun, Tom,” called Mrs. Putland cheerily. She
was putting a suet pudding into the oven, with the
kitchen door wide open, and saw him as he crossed the
yard.</p>

<p>“Mornun, ma’am. Is the maaster at home?”</p>

<p>“Maaster’s over at Satanstown buying a calf. Can
I give him your message?”</p>

<p>“Faather says as it’s taake it or leave it about them
roots.”</p>

<p>“Then I reckon he’ll taake it. He never wur the man
to higgle-haggle, and the roots is good roots.”</p>

<p>“Justabout valiant—I never got a tidier crop out of
Podder’s field.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Putland had come to the door and stood looking
at him, with her arms akimbo. She was a small, trim
woman, buttoned and sleeked, and somehow the expression
of her face was the same as the expression of the
house—the clean, kindly, enquiring look of Egypt with
its white-framed staring windows and smooth, ruddy
tiles.</p>

<p>“It’ll be unaccountable sad fur your faather to lose
you. You’ve bin the prop-stick of Worge this five year.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped. I’ve got to go. Had my calling-up
paapers this mornun.”</p>

<p>“That’s queer. So did Bill. Reckon you’ll go together.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Didn’t Bill try fur exemption, then?”</p>

<p>“No—Mus’ Lamb wouldn’t have it. Besides, there
wurn’t no reason as he should stay. We’ve done wudout
him here since he went to the Manor, and Mus’ Lamb
ull kip his plaace fur him till he comes back.”</p>

<p>Tom envied Bill his free heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll give him a call,” continued Bill’s mother. “He
aun’t due up at the Manor fur an hour yit, and he wur
saying only last night as he never sees you now.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Bill answered his mother’s call,
and sauntered round the corner of the house, his hands
in his pockets, his chauffeur’s cap a little on one side.
He had a handsome, fresh-coloured face, strangely cheeky
for a country boy’s, and Tom always felt rather ill at
ease in his presence, a little awed by the fact that though
his hands might sometimes be brown and greasy with
motor-oil, his body was of a well-washed whiteness unknown
at Worge.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Tom.”</p>

<p>There had never been a very deep friendship between
them; Bill was inclined to be patronising, and Tom both
to resent it and to envy him. But to-day a new, mysterious
bond was linking them. In the pocket of Bill’s
neat livery there was a paper exactly like that in Tom’s
manure-slopped corduroys.</p>

<p>“I hear you’ve bin called up, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Yes—in a fortnight, they say.”</p>

<p>“I’m going too—in a fortnight.”</p>

<p>“Pleased?”</p>

<p>“No. I’m unaccountable vrothered at leaving the
farm. Wot d’you feel about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, me?—I’m not sorry. They’ll keep my place open
for me at the Manor, and I shall like getting a hit at
Kayser Bill. Besides, the gals think twice as much of
you if you’re in uniform.”</p>

<p>This was a new complexion on the case, and Tom’s
thoughts wandered down to the shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“I shall like being along of Mus’ Archie, too—he told
me I could be along of him. We’re all eighteenth Sussex
hereabouts. I reckon you’ll be in with us.”</p>

<p>“I dunno.”</p>

<p>Tom’s brows were crinkled, for he was thinking hard.
He was chewing the fact that for a free man there might
be something rather pleasant in soldiering. This happy,
conceited, self-confident little chauffeur was teaching him
that the soldier’s lot was not entirely dark. “Called
up”—“taken”—“fetched along”—those were the words of
his conscript’s vocabulary. But now for the first time he
saw something beyond them, a voluntary endeavour beyond
the conscript’s obedience, a corporate enthusiasm
beyond his lonely unwillingness. “We’re all eighteenth
Sussex hereabouts....”</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>April was May before Tom’s weeks of grace had run.
The field hollows were white with drifts of hawthorn,
and the pale purplish haze of the cuckoo-flower had given
place to the buttercups’ dabble of gold. The papery-white
of the wild cherry had gone from the woods, which
were green now, thick, and full of the nutty smell of
leaves. The ditches were milky with fennel, and on the
high meadows by Thunders Hill the broom and the gorse
clumped their yellows together, making the hill a flaming
cone to those who saw it from the marshes of Horse Eye.</p>

<p>The farmers of Dallington watched their hayfields
rust. There was little corn in that country bounded by
the Four Roads, so as the sun climbed higher noon by
noon, the neighbourhood grew gipsy-brown—the straw-coloured
feathers of the grass veiled a glowing heart of
clover, and above them opened the white ox-eyes and
pools of sorrel....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Beatup watched ripen the fields whose harvest
he would not see. There were some twenty acres of hay
at Worge, and two fields in which the green corn was his
hope and dread. The crop was promising on the whole—a
bit sedge-leaved perhaps, but firm in its seed. There
were the hops, too, in the low fields by Puddledock, where
Forges Wood shut off the north-east wind. He trundled
the insect-sprayer round the bines, and afterwards loved
the smell of his green, sticky hands.</p>

<p>He would have been rightly offended if anyone had
told him that his chief pangs of parting were for the
farm. None the less, there was a lingering wistfulness in
his last dealings with it which was not in his intercourse
with his family. He loved his mother, he admired his
father, he felt for his brothers and sisters an elder
brother’s half-anxious, half-contemptuous fondness; but
in his last services for Worge, whether in field or barn,
there was something almost sacramental. His duties were
rites—he was the unconscious priest of that tumble-down
altar before which the manure smoked as incense and on
which the burnt-offering of his boyhood lay.</p>

<p>He had, too, a hunger for the fields, not only the fields
of Worge, but for all those within the Four Roads—which
he did not see as roads leading to adventure, but
as boundaries fencing home. When his tasks allowed
he would roam in the webbing of tracks that the farms
have spun between the lanes—he would go to Starnash
or Oxbottom Town, watch the lightless sky grow purple
over Muddles Green, and the big stars begin to spark it
as the moon hung like a red lamp above Mystole Wood.
High on the zenith the sky would be rainy green, and he
would watch it deepen to purple round the crimson moon,
all unconscious of its beauty, loving it only because it
hung above this clay in which his feet were stuck, because

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>

from it came the brightness which waked the
homely things he had put in the earth to sleep....</p>

<p>Sometimes he would be disturbed by another quest,
and would beat slowly up and down on the road outside
the shop, longing to go in and yet strangely reluctant.
He felt all tied-up and dumb. He could not tell Thyrza
Honey what he felt at leaving her any more than he
could have told Starnash or Thunders Hill—than he
could have told the little brother who lay against him
on cold nights—or the dreamy-eyed cows he milked—or
even the grinning, whining watch-dog who muddied him
with his love. He was dumb, as all these were dumb.
He felt unaccountable vrothered at having to leave them
all, and that was the utmost he could say; and yet he
knew that in Thyrza’s case, at any rate, it was not
enough. A man with a better tongue than he would
have gone into that shop, and shut himself into the light
and tea-smelling warmth, instead of pacing up and down
under the cold stars.</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>On the last day of all he plucked up courage. He
could not go without saying good-bye, and he had always
brought her the big things of his life—from his buying
of a horse-rake to the news of the Tribunal’s decision—though
each time he had wrapped his need in some penny
purchase of tobacco or sweets.</p>

<p>The little bell buzzed and ting’d. The shop was empty
and rather dark, for a grey starless dusk was on the
fields after a rainy day. The wind rattled the door he
had shut behind him, and moaned round the little leaded
window banked up with penny toys and tins of fruit.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>

It had a long sighing sweep over the fields from Bird-in-Eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">and just across the road was a willow pond, from</span><br />
which it seemed to drink sadness. Over the banks of
papered tins and paint-slopped toys he could see the grey
bending backs of the willows, and the steely ruffle of the
pond under the wind. His throat grew tight with a word
that was stuck in it—“Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The door of the back room opened, and there was a
leap of firelight and the song of a kettle before it shut.</p>

<p>“Evenun, Mus’ Tom,” said Mrs. Honey.</p>

<p>“Evenun,” said Tom. “A packet of Player’s, please.”</p>

<p>Thyrza put it on the counter. “Any sweeties?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll taake a quarter of bull’s-eyes and four-penn’orth
of telephones. I woan’t leave them behind me
this time”—and Tom grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Your brothers and sisters ull miss you,” said Thyrza,
poking with a knife at the sticky wedge of the bull’s-eyes.</p>

<p>“Not more’n I’ll miss them and the whole plaace.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s sad to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“Unaccountable sad.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on him very tenderly. She was
sorry for Tom Beatup—had always been a little sorry
for him—she could not quite tell why.</p>

<p>“It’ll be a long time before I see you again, Thyrza.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not—you may git leave and come to see us.”</p>

<p>He shook his head——“Not yet awhile.”</p>

<p>His parcels lay before him, but she did not expect him
to go. He was leaning across the counter, staring at her
with big, solemn eyes, and she knew that she liked his
face, broad and ruddy as a September moon, that she
liked the whole sturdy set of him.</p>

<p>“Stay and have a bit of supper wud me, Tom.” It
was quite unconsciously that they had become Tom and
Thyrza to each other.</p>

<p>The colour burned into his cheeks, but he shook his
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, thank you kindly. I’ve got to git back
hoame. I’ve a dunnamany things to do this last
evenun.”</p>

<p>“Then come on your fust leave.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I will——Oh, Thryza!”</p>

<p>His hunger had outrun his shyness. He was trembling.
She had lifted her hand to smooth back the soft
fuzz of her hair, which in the dusk had become the
colour of hay in starlight, and as she dropped her hand,
he caught it, and held it, then kissed it. It was warm
and wide and soft and rather sticky.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tommy——”</p>

<p>“D’you mind, Thyrza?”</p>

<p>“I?—Lord, no, dear.”</p>

<p>He was still holding her hand across the counter, and
now he slowly pulled her towards him. Her darling face
was coming closer to him out of the shadows; he could
smell her hair....</p>

<p>Buzz—Ting.</p>

<p>Their hands dropped and they started upright, both
looking utterly foolish. The Reverend Henry Poullett-Smith
sniffed an air of constraint as he entered.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mrs. Honey. I came to leave this—er—notice
about the Empire Day performance at the
schools. Perhaps you’ll be so kind as to show it in the
window, and—er—come yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I’ll put it here by the tinned salmon.
That’s what gets looked at most.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mrs. Honey. Hullo, Beatup—I didn’t
see you in this dim light.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be gitting the lamp,” said Thyrza.</p>

<p>Tom swept his parcels off the counter into his pockets,
and muttered something about “hoame.”</p>

<p>“This is your last day, isn’t it?” asked the curate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yessir. Off to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Sorry?”</p>

<p>“Middling sorry, for some reasons.”</p>

<p>“But it will be a big experience for you.”</p>

<p>The curate was young, and sometimes vaguely
hankered after that adventure in which no priests but
those of godless France might share. It was hard to
see it being wasted on a pudding-headed chap like
Beatup.</p>

<p>Tom only grunted his reply to this challenge. He was
angry with the parson for having come into the shop,
discreet as had been his entry. He did not think of
waiting till he had gone, for somehow no one, especially
a man, ever left Thyrza’s shop in a hurry, as if the
tranquil dawdle of the shopkeeper communicated itself
to her customers, making them lounge and linger long
after their purchases were made.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Mrs. Honey.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, and good luck,” said the curate, shaking
hands.</p>

<p>The bell buzzed again, and Tom was out in the throb
and shudder of the wind, while Thyrza lit the lamp in
the house behind him.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>When he reached home he found all the family at
supper, except Harry, who after a fortnight’s doubtful
virtue had, on his brother’s last night at home, escapaded
off with two young Sindens from Little Worge. Mrs.
Beatup was inclined to be tearful about it. “Wot we’ll
do when you’re agone, Tom, Lord only knows.” Of late
she had taken to treating Tom’s departure as a voluntary,
not to say capricious, act, and her frequent lamentations
were gabbled with reproach, vague hints that if

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

he had liked he could have prevented the catastrophe—precisely
how, she never told him.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup was not drunk. Only a negative statement
could describe him, for neither was he sober. An
alcoholic Laodicean, neither hot nor cold, he lolled over
the head of the table, and argued with Nell, the pupil-teacher,
on the utter futility of the Church of England,
or, indeed, any sort of Church. It was characteristic of
Nell that she would argue with her father, drunk or
sober. She had championed her causes against a far
less responsible adversary than she had before her to-day.
Her cheeks were pink with refutation, and her little
sighs and exclamations and chipped beginnings of phrases
popped like corks round Mus’ Beatup’s droning eloquence—that
eloquence which so filled Tom with admiration
and made him boast of his father’s book-learning among
the farms.</p>

<p>“It’s as plain as the nose on your face, and has all bin
proved over and over again as there wuren’t no such
persons as Adam and Eve. There’s a chap called Darwin’s
proved as we’re the offsprings of monkeys, and a
chap called Bradlaugh ’s proved as we all come out of
stuff called prottoplasm—so where are your Adam and
Eve, I’d lik to know?”</p>

<p>“But, father, as if it mattered. The Church....”</p>

<p>“The Church is there to prove as the world was maade
in six days, when it’s bin proved over and over again
as it hasn’t.”</p>

<p>“The Church is there for no such thing—it’s——”</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s bin proved as it’s there for that very
purpose.”</p>

<p>“Who’s proved it?”</p>

<p>“Darwin and Huxley and Bradlaugh, and a lot more
clever chaps.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“But they lived years ago, and it’s——”</p>

<p>“Not so many years ago as your Adam and Eve, and
yet you go and believe in them....”</p>

<p>“I don’t. Not in the sense....”</p>

<p>“When it’s bin proved as there never wur no Adam
and Eve. The fust people wur monkeys, descended from
prottoplasm, and then caum the missing lynx and then
caum us. I tell you it’s all bin proved over and over
again, and parson chaps and silly gals aun’t likely to
prove anything different.”</p>

<p>Tom listened respectfully, if rather grudgingly, to this
learned conversation. He wanted to talk to his father
about one or two matters concerning the farm, but knew
there would be no chance for him to-night. He kept up
at intervals a grunting intercourse with his mother, who
wanted every other minute to know where he’d been and
where Harry had got to, and what in the Lord’s name
they were to do without him. Into the bargain, he ate
a hearty supper, for though he was in love and rather
miserable, he was also a healthy young animal, sharp-set
after a day in the open air.</p>

<p>At last the theological argument ended, not because it
was any nearer solution or had indeed moved at all
from its first premises, but because the end of supper
dispersed the combatants, Nell to her work, and Mus’
Beatup, ignominiously, to the kitchen sink. Having relieved
his stomach of its load of bad beer and half-masticated
food, he went grumbling upstairs to bed,
wondering what we were all coming to nowadays, and
why nobody stopped the war.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup reckoned, with a sigh, that she had better
go to bed too, as Maaster didn’t like it if she disturbed
him later. So she lit her candle, and went slowly creaking
upstairs, leaving Ivy to clear away the supper.
Just where the stairs bent, she suddenly stood still, as
if a thought had struck her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tom,” she called.</p>

<p>He was cleaning his boots in the outer kitchen, but
when he heard her he ran up to where she stood, thick
against her monstrous shadow in the angle of the stairs.</p>

<p>“It’s queer as you never think of kissing your
mother.”</p>

<p>He had not kissed her for weeks, but now, suddenly
troubled, he did so.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, mother.”</p>

<p>“And so you may be—on your last night, too.”</p>

<p>He stood looking at her sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Well, git down to your business. I mustn’t linger,
or Maaster ull be gitting into bed in his boots.”</p>

<p>He went downstairs, feeling suddenly smartingly sorry
for his mother as she waddled upwards to this drunkard’s
bed. He saw that her lot was a hard one.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>The passage was in darkness, and Tom did not see, but
felt, the side door swing open, with a damp drench of
wind from the yard. There was a grey mist in the
passage. The next minute a white stick-like thing flew
out of it, suddenly like the wind, and then bumped into
Tom, with the unexpected contact of warm flesh against
his hands, and “Oo-er,” in Harry’s voice.</p>

<p>“Harry....”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s you, Tom? Lemme git up and fetch some
cloathes.”</p>

<p>“But where’s those as you went out in?”</p>

<p>“I dunno. I’ll tell you afterwards, but I’m coald, and
I want my supper.”</p>

<p>The slow, facile anger of his type went tingling into
Tom’s speech and hands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<p>“Supper! I’m hemmed if you git so much as a bite.
Tell me this wunst where you left your cloathes or I’ll
knock your head off, surelye.”</p>

<p>He laid violent hands on Harry, who was, however,
far too slippery to hold. He was free in a minute and
dashed into the outer kitchen, slamming the door after
him.</p>

<p>When Tom came in he was sitting tailor-fashion on
the table, gnawing the top of a cottage loaf. The elder
brother could not help laughing at him, he looked such
a queer goblin creature.</p>

<p>“Doan’t be vrothered, Tom,” whined Harry, taking
advantage of his relenting—“it’s your last night at
home.”</p>

<p>Tom winced—they were always throwing it at him,
his “last night.”</p>

<p>“Lucky fur you as it is—and unlucky fur me—and
unlucky fur Worge if this is the way you’re going on
when I’m a-gone. Where’ve you bin?”</p>

<p>“Only over to Bucksteep, Tom.”</p>

<p>“But wot have you done wud your clothes?”</p>

<p>“Mus’ Archie’s got ’em.”</p>

<p>“Wot d’you mean? Spik the truth.”</p>

<p>“It’s Bible truth. Willie and Peter Sinden and Bob
Pix and me thought as how we’d bathe by moonlight in
Bucksteep pond, and Mus’ Archie’s hoame on leave, and
he wur walking wud his young woman in the paddock,
and he sawed us, and took all our cloathes whiles we wur
in the water. He thought as how he’d got us then, and
that we couldn’t git away wudout our cloathes. But
he’s found he’s wrong, fur we climbed up the far bank
into Throws Wood, and ran hoame.”</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me as you’ve come in your skin all
the way from Bucksteep?”</p>

<p>Harry nodded, and laughed at some Puckish memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, all I wonder is as you wurn’t took and put in
gaol—you would have been if policeman had met you—and
you’ll catch your death of cold.”</p>

<p>He pulled off his coat and most ungently bundled
Harry into it. Then another idea struck him. He
groaned, and scratched his head.</p>

<p>“I must write to Mus’ Archie this wunst.”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom?”</p>

<p>“To git your clothes back. We can’t afford to lose a
good suit of clothes.”</p>

<p>He turned wearily to the cupboard, and took out a
penny ink-bottle, a pen, and some cheap writing-paper.</p>

<p>“Tom—he’ll know it wur me if you write.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help that—we must git your clothes back.”</p>

<p>“But they were only old cloathes.”</p>

<p>“Adone-do, Harry. We can’t afford to lose so much
as an old shirt. Oh, you’re vrothering me to madness
wud your doings.”</p>

<p>He began to scrawl in his slow, round hand. He was
no letter-writer, and found it difficult to put his request
into words. He also wanted to plead for Harry, to
explain a little of his own hard case, and ask that the
matter might be allowed to stop at the scare and scolding
Harry had received, for “I am joining up to-morrow,
and it is very hard to leave them all like this, from your
obedient servant Thomas Beatup.”</p>

<p>Harry watched him, bobbing over the sheet, every
now and then passing his tongue over his lips in the
agony of composition. Then suddenly he slid towards
him across the table and put his arm round his neck.</p>

<p>Tom shook him off.</p>

<p>“Git away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m sorry I’m such a hemmed curse to you, Tom.”</p>

<p>“You’re a hemmed curse indeed. I ask you to be a
man in my plaace, and you’re no more than a tedious
liddle child.”</p>

<p>A sudden sense of the hopelessness of it all came over
him—the net in which he struggled, in which he was
being dragged away from those he could help and love.
He dropped his head in his hands. Harry stood for a
moment awestruck beside him, a grotesque figure with
Tom’s coat hanging over his bare thighs. Then he
turned and crept away to bed.</p>

<p>The clock struck nine, and Tom lifted his head. He
was utterly weary, but he knew that if he did not take
his letter over to Bucksteep to-night he would not have
time in the morning. There was no good leaving it to
other hands to deliver, for he felt that his mother would
resent its humble tone, and perhaps send instead an angry
demand which, by rousing Mus’ Archie’s rage, might end
by landing Harry before the Senlac Bench. So he put on
his father’s driving coat, which hung in the passage and
smelt of manure and stale spirits, and let himself out into
the soft, throbbing darkness, lit only by a few dim stars
of the Plough.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>Bucksteep Manor was the smaller kind of country-house,
smuggled away from the cross-roads in a larch
plantation, with a tennis lawn at the back, and a more
open view swinging over a copsed valley to Rushlake
Green. It had once been a farmhouse, but a wing had
been added in modern style, and inside, the low raftering
had been swept away, so that when Tom stood in the
dimly-lighted hall, which had once been the kitchen, he
could look up to a ceiling dizzily high to his sag-roofed
experience.</p>

<p>The Lambs were the aristocracy of Dallington, a
neighbourhood strikingly empty of “society” in the
country-house sense. They had themselves been yeoman

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>

farmers a couple of generations back, and the present
squire still interested himself shamefacedly in Bucksteep’s
hundred acres. The Beatups had but little truck
with the Manor; precarious yeomen, no rents or dues
demanded intercourse, and Mus’ Beatup had often been
heard to say that some folks were no better than other
folks, for all their airs and acres.</p>

<p>Tom had given his letter to a rustling parlourmaid,
and stood meekly waiting for an answer, his large bovine
eyes blinking with sleepiness. From an adjoining room
came the throaty music of a gramophone, playing:</p>

<p>
“When we wind up the Watch on the Rhine<br />
Everything will be Potsdam fine....”<br />
</p>

<p>There was girls’ laughter, too—probably Miss Marian
Lamb and Mus’ Archie’s intended—and every now and
then he heard Mrs. Lamb’s voice go rocketing up. He
did not feel envious of all this jollity, neither did it grate
upon him; he just stood and waited under the shaded
lamps of the hall, and had nearly fallen asleep on his
legs when suddenly the door opened, with a flood of
light and noise, and shut again behind Mus’ Archie.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Beatup. Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I couldn’t make this out at first—had no idea your
young brother was one of the culprits to-night, or I
shouldn’t have played that trick on ’em.”</p>

<p>“It doan’t matter, sir. Harry desarved it. It’s only
as we can’t afford to lose the clothes.”</p>

<p>“No, no, of course not. Come with me and pick his
out of the pile, and you can take them home.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mus’ Archie.”</p>

<p>He followed young Lamb into a little gun-room opening
on the hall, and was able to pick out Harry’s rather
bobtail toilet from a muddle of Sinden and Pix raiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all, is it? Wan’t anything to wrap ’em in?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, it aun’t worth it. Thank you kindly for
letting me have the things.”</p>

<p>“There was never any question of you not having
them. I’ve no right to keep ’em. So you’re joining
up to-morrow?”</p>

<p>He was in uniform, but without his belt. Somehow to
Tom he seemed a burlier, browner man than the young
squire whom before the war he used to see out hunting,
or shooting, or driving girls in his car.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m joining up, as they say.”</p>

<p>“You don’t seem over-pleased about it.”</p>

<p>“I aun’t, particular.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to tell you it’s the grandest job on
earth, and that all the chaps out there are having the
time of their lives. It wouldn’t be true, though I expect
the Tribunal told you so.”</p>

<p>“Yessir; they said as if they were only ten years
younger they’d all be in it.”</p>

<p>“Of course they did. Well, I’ve been out there, and
I’ve seen.... But never mind; you’ll find that out for
yourself, Beatup. However, I’ll say this much—it isn’t
a nice job, or a grand job, or even a good job; but it’s a
job that’s got to be done, and when it’s done we’ll like
to think that Sussex chaps helped do it.”</p>

<p>Tom’s heart warmed a little towards Mus’ Archie.
He was making him feel as he had felt when Bill Putland
said, “We’re all eighteenth Sussex hereabouts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[</a></span></p>

<p>“It aun’t the going as un vrother me, if it wurn’t fur
leaving Worge. I’m fretted as the plaace ull land at the
auctioneer’s if I’m long away. You see, I’ve always done
most of the work, in my head as well as wud my hands.
Faather, he aun’t a healthy man, and the others aun’t
much help nuther. There’s only Harry lik to be any use,
and he’s such an unaccountable limb of wickedness—for
ever at his tricks—to-night’s only one of them.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’ll pull himself together and work for
Worge when he sees you’ve gone to fight for it.”</p>

<p>This was new light on the matter for Tom. Hitherto
he had always thought of himself as deserting Worge in
its hour of need—it had never occurred to him that his
going was the going of a champion, not of a traitor.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s as you say, Mus’ Archie. Leastways,
we’ll hope so.”</p>

<p>They were in the hall again now, and the gramophone
was singing in its spooky voice. “You called me Baby
Doll a year ago.” Tom slowly turned the handle of the
front door, sidling out on to the step.</p>

<p>“Thank you for the clothes, Mus’ Archie. I’ll try and
talk some sense into Harry before I go.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Beatup, and good luck to you. I expect
I’ll see some more of you in the near future. All
the chaps round here seem to be drafted into the eighteenth.
Bill Putland will be in our little crowd, and
Jerry Sumption—there’ll be quite a Dallington set at
Waterheel.”</p>

<p>“I hope I’ll be with you, Mus’ Archie.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will, Beatup. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, sir.”</p>

<p>The door shut, and he was out in the drive, where the
larches swung against the moon.</p>

<p>Archie Lamb went back into the drawing-room, and
put a new record on the gramophone.</p>

<p>“Queer chap, Beatup,” he said to his mother. “I don’t
know how he’ll shape. He looks strong and steady, but
I should say about as smart as a mangold-wurzel.”</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>Tom swung along the dim road, where the shadows
ran before him. The new-risen moon looked over the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>

hedge, an amber disc just past the full, swimming against
the wind from Satanstown. In the heart of the wind
seemed still to beat the pulse of those far-off guns, the
ghost of their day-long thunder. Over and over in his
mind Tom turned his new thought—that he was going to
fight for Worge.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour he had come to Sunday Street.
He could see the moonlight lying like frost on the southward
slope of the roofs, and the windows of the Bethel
were ghostly with it, as they stared away to the marshes.
The Bethel alone seemed awake in the little huddle of
sleeping cottages—it had a strange look of watchfulness
and waiting, its gaunt Georgian windows never had that
comfortable blinking air of the cottage lattices....
Tom did not like the Bethel at night.</p>

<p>He looked across the road to the Horselunges, where
Mr. Sumption lived. A crack of light showed under the
blind of the minister’s room, and Tom’s heart gave a
little thump of self-reproach, for he had not till then
thought of saying good-bye to him. He had not seen
much of Mr. Sumption lately, and had been too much
absorbed in his own concerns to think of him, but now
he made up his mind to call and say good-bye; it was
past ten o’clock and he was very tired and sleepy, nevertheless
he walked up to the door of the Horselunges and
knocked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hubble was in bed, as the hour demanded, so the
door was opened by her lodger.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom. Anything the matter? Do they want
me at Worge?”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption was always childishly eager for some
demand on his pastoral ministrations, a demand which
was seldom made, as he had a disruptive bedside manner
and the funds of his chapel did not admit of the doles

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>

which made sick Dallington people endure the consolations
of the Church.</p>

<p>“No, thank you, they doan’t. I’ve just come to say
good-bye.”</p>

<p>The minister’s forehead clouded—</p>

<p>“Oh, you’ve remembered me at last, have you?
Thought it just as well not to forget old friends before
you go off to make new ones. Come in.”</p>

<p>Tom, who had expected this greeting, followed Mr.
Sumption upstairs into the room which he called his
study, but which had few points of difference from any
cottage living-room in Sunday Street. There was a
frayed carpet with a lot of dirt trodden into it, and a
sun-sucked wall-paper adhering as closely as possible to
walls complicate of beams and bulges. A solitary book-shelf
supported <cite>Jessica’s First Prayer</cite>, <cite>Edwin’s Trial or
The Little Christian Witness</cite>, and kindred works, cheek-by-jowl
with <cite>Burton’s Four Last Things</cite> and a cage of
white mice. There was another cage hanging in the
window, containing a broken-winged thrush which the
pastor, after the failure of many anathemas, had bought
from one of those mysterious gangs of small boys which
prowl round villages. An old, old cat sat before the
empty grate, too decrepit to make more than one attempt
a day on the thrush or the mice, and now purring wheezily
in the intervals of scratching a cankered ear.</p>

<p>On the table was a wild, unwieldy parcel, from whose
bursting sides the contents were already beginning to
ooze forth.</p>

<p>“I’m packing a parcel for Jerry,” said the minister.
“I’d just finished when you knocked.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if it was coming undone,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“So it does”—and Mr. Sumption glanced deprecatingly
at his handiwork.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>

“If only I had some sealing-wax ... but the shop’s shut.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be open to-morrow,” said Tom, and pictured
Thyrza pulling up the blind and dusting the salmon-tins
in the window ... long after he had gone to catch the
early train from Hailsham.</p>

<p>“Well, to-morrow’s time enough, as I can’t post it
before then. It ud be a pity for anything to get
lost. There’s three shillings’ worth of things in that
parcel.”</p>

<p>“Have you had any more letters from Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I had one yesterday”—no need to tell Tom
there had been no others—“He wants chocolate and
cigarettes, and I put in a tin of cocoa besides, and some
little squares to make soup of. He’ll be unaccountable
pleased.”</p>

<p>“How’s he gitting on?”</p>

<p>“Valiant. He likes being along of the other lads.
The only thing that worrits him is your sister.”</p>

<p>“My sister?”</p>

<p>“Yes, your sister Ivy. Seemingly she never answered
a postcard he wrote her ten days back, and you knows
he’s unaccountable set on Ivy.”</p>

<p>“It aun’t no use, Mus’ Sumption. Ivy’s got no thought
for him, I’m certain sure, and he’s only wasting time over
her.”</p>

<p>The minister’s comely face darkened, and he cracked
his fingers once or twice.</p>

<p>“It’s a pity, a lamentable pity. That boy of mine’s
crazy on Ivy Beatup. Are you sure she doesn’t care
about him, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Well, who knows wot a gal thinks? I can only put
two and two together. But seemingly if she’d cared
she’d have answered his postcard.”</p>

<p>“Could you put in a word for him?”</p>

<p>Young Beatup shook his head—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I woan’t meddle. If Ivy doan’t care I can’t maake
her, and I reckon mother’s unaccountable set against it
too.”</p>

<p>He had said the wrong thing. Mr. Sumption’s eyes
became like burning pits. He swung his hands up and
cracked them like a pistol.</p>

<p>“Set against it, is she? Set against my Jerry? Maybe
he isn’t good enough for her—a clergyman’s son for a
farmer’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“I never said naun of that,” mumbled Tom uneasily,
remembering his mother’s reference to “gipsy muck.”</p>

<p>“It’s I as might be set against it,” continued the
minister. “I tell you that boy’s been bred and cut above
your sister. I never sent him to a board school along
of farmers’ children—I taught him myself, everything I
learned at college. He’d know as much I do if he
hadn’t forgotten it. Yet I’m not proud; I know the boy
wants your sister Ivy and ull do something silly if he
can’t get her, so when he writes to me, ‘Where’s Ivy?
Find out why she didn’t answer my postcard, and tell her
I’ll go mad if she doesn’t take some notice of me’—why,
then, I do my best—and get told my son’s not good
enough for your father’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“I never told you any such thing,” said Tom doggedly,
“but I woan’t spik to Ivy. She knows her own
business best. If I were you I’d tell Jerry straight as
no good ull come of his going after her. She doan’t want
him—I’m certain sure of that.”</p>

<p>The pastor’s wrath had died down into something
more piteous.</p>

<p>“I daresay you’re right, Tom, and maybe I did wrong
to speak like that. After all, I was only a blacksmith till
the Lord called me away.... I pray that He may not
require my boasting of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m unaccountable sorry about Ivy being lik
that, but I thought it better to spik plain.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption sat down rather heavily at the table.</p>

<p>“O Lord, how shall I tell Jerry? If I tell him he’ll do
something wild, sure as he’s Jerry Sumption.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t tell him. He’ll find out for himself soon
enough.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption groaned.</p>

<p>“Tom Beatup,” he said slowly, “I reckon you think
I’m a faithless, unprofitable steward so to set my heart
on human flesh and blood. But you’ll understand a bit
of what I feel ... some day, when you’re the father
of a son.”</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>The pale morning ray came slanting over the sky
from Harebeating towards the last stars. Slowly the
trees and hedges loomed out against the trembling yellow
pools of the dawn. Colours woke in the fields, soft hazy
greens, and blues and greys that ran together like smoke
... ponds began to gleam among the spinneys, discs
of mirrored sky, that from lustreless white became glassy
yellow, then kindled from glass to fire, then smouldered
from fire to rust.</p>

<p>Tom saw the window square light up and frame the
familiar picture of a life’s mornings—the oasthouse, the
lombardy poplar topping the barn, the little patch of
distant fields seen between the oast and the jutting farmhouse
gable. The bed was pulled up close to the
window, to allow of the door being opened, and he could
lie on his side and look straight out at the loved common
things which perhaps he might never see just so again.</p>

<p>It all looked very quiet, and rather cold, and the early
sunless light gave it a peculiar lifelessness, as if it was
something painted, or cut in cardboard. Even Tom was
conscious of its cold, dreamlike quality; he always said

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>

that “the yard looked corpsy at break o’ day.” Then
the distant view of little fields suddenly swam into
golden light, as a long finger of sunlight stroked the barn-roofs,
then stabbed in at the window, throwing a shaft of
dancing golden motes across the room. Tom rose,
climbed out of bed over Zacky, and in about three square
feet of floor space shaved and dressed. Then he went
downstairs, unlocked the house door and stole out to his
last morning’s work.</p>

<p>No one was about; it was not till more than an hour
later that the two antique farm-hands, Elphick and
Juglery, came up from Worge Cottages. By that time
Tom had milked the cows, mixed the chicken food, and
driven the horses down to Forges field. He gave the two
unskilled labourers their orders for the day as if he expected
to be there to see them carried out. By that
time Ivy was hunting for eggs, and Mrs. Beatup was
struggling with the kitchen fire, while Mus’ Beatup, in
practical, unlearned mood, had gone to the Sunk field to
inspect the ewes.</p>

<p>As Ivy came out of the hen-house and crossed the
yard, cheery, healthy, blowsy, with eggs in a bowl, Tom
had a sudden thought of giving her Mr. Sumption’s
message. But he held his tongue. He had meant what
he said when he told the minister he was not going to
meddle. He had long been convinced of the fact that
his sister knew her own business; besides, Jerry ...
that lousy gipsy chap.... Pastor might say he was
getting on valiant, but all Dallington knew that he had
been given seven days C.B. within a week of his joining.</p>

<p>So, with nothing for Ivy but a nod, Tom went in to
breakfast. Time was short, but the breakfast was still
in a rudimentary state. Mrs. Beatup fought with the
kitchen fire among whorls of smoke, while Nell, coughing
pathetically, laid the table. Harry in a fit of brotherly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>

love was cleaning Tom’s best boots ready for his journey
to Lewes—no one ever went to Lewes in any but Sunday
clothes.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you, Tom? I hope as you aun’t in a
hurry. This fire’s bewitched. Nell, give your brother
a cut off the loaf. You’d better git started, Tom, or
you’ll lose your train.”</p>

<p>So Tom’s last breakfast at Worge was eaten in confusion
and mess, the family dropping in one by one for
cuts off the loaf or helpings of cold bacon spotted with
large blisters of grease. Last of all the breakfast arrived,
in the shape of the tea-pot, and a special boiled egg for
Tom. He was not able to do more than gulp down the
egg and scald himself with the tea. Then it was time to
go. He had already tied up a few little things in a
handkerchief—a razor, a piece of soap, an old frosted
Christmas card which for some obscure reason he treasured—so
there was nothing to do but to say good-bye
and beat it for Hailsham, a good seven miles.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup put down his tea-cup and looked solemn.</p>

<p>“Well, good-bye, my lad. I reckon you’ve got to go.
Everyone’s off to fight now, seemingly, so I suppose you
must do wot others do. Not that I think so much of
this war as some folks seem to—it’s bin going on nigh
two years now, and I can’t see as we’re any of us a penny
the better off. Howsumdever....”</p>

<p>“He’s going to stop it,” said Nell, her face pink.</p>

<p>“Ho, is he? Well, I’ve no objection. Maybe I’ll write
you a letter, Tom, when Maudie calves.”</p>

<p>“I’d be much obliged if you would, faather, and tell
me how the wheat does this year, and them new oats by
the Street.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Tom,” said Harry.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>

“I shall miss you unaccountable.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll miss you, too,” said Zacky, “but there’ll
be more room in the bed.”</p>

<p>Tom kissed them sheepishly all round, then walked
out of the door without a word.</p>

<p>He was in the yard, when he heard footsteps creaking
after him, and turned round to see his mother.</p>

<p>“Wait a bit, Tom,” she panted; “I’ll go wud you to
the geate.”</p>

<p>He was surprised, but it did not strike him to say so.
They walked down the drive together almost in silence,
the boy hanging his head. Mrs. Beatup sniffed and
choked repeatedly.</p>

<p>“Doan’t go near those Germans, Tom,” she said,
when they came to a standstill. “If you do, you’ll be
killed for certain sure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go where I’m put, surelye,” said Tom gloomily.</p>

<p>“Well, be careful, that’s all. Kip well behind the
other lads, and doan’t go popping your head over walls
or meddling wud cannons. And kip your feet dry, Tom,
and doan’t git into temptation.”</p>

<p>“I promise, mother,” he mumbled against her neck, and
they kissed each other many times before she let him go.</p>

<p>The Rifle Volunteer looked down from his sign, where
he stood in the grey uniform and mutton-chop whiskers
of an earlier dispensation, and stared at the stocky,
shambling little figure that trudged its unwilling way to
sacrifice—past Worge Cottages, stewing in the sunshine
like pippins, past Egypt Farm (which Bill Putland would
leave later and more conveniently in his father’s dog-cart),
past the shop, with a glance half shy, half beseeching,
at the drawn blinds, past the willow pond, out
of Sunday Street, into the long yellow road that led to
the unsought, undesired adventure.</p>

<h2>PART II: JERRY</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. BEATUP’S tears ran down her face as she
hurried back up the drive, but she wiped them
vigorously away with her apron, and had nothing
but her red eyes to show when she entered the kitchen.
Everyone had gone, except Ivy and Nell. The former
had not finished her hearty breakfast, the latter was
packing her books for school, and some sort of a wrangle
was going on between them. Mrs. Beatup heard Nell
call Ivy “vulgar” just as she came into the room. Ivy
laughed, truly a vulgar performance with her mouth full.</p>

<p>“Now, you two gals, doan’t you start quarrelling just
when you brother’s a-gone; maybe fur ever.”</p>

<p>“We aun’t quarrelling,” said Ivy. “I’ve told her she’s
sweet on parson, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“All!” sniffed Nell. “Maybe you think it’s nothing
to have your vulgar mind making out my—my friendship
with Mr. Poullett-Smith’s the same as yours with—with—anyone
that ull let you make sheep’s eyes at
him.”</p>

<p>“Nell!” cried her mother. “For shaum!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t care”—the younger girl’s anger had
been roused by many coarse flicks—“everyone talks about
Ivy’s goings-on.”</p>

<p>“I doan’t care if they do,” said Ivy cavernously in
her tea-cup. “Reckon it’s cos they’re jealous of me
gitting the boys.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ivy,” said Mrs. Beatup,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

“I doan’t hold wud your goings-on, nuther; but anyway
you’re useful.”</p>

<p>“I’m earning money, though,” said Nell; “at least
I shall be when my third year’s up.”</p>

<p>“And how soon ull that be, I’d lik to know? There
you go, out all day, when you might be helping us at
home, and not a penny to show fur it.”</p>

<p>“Mother, I’ve told you again and again—why won’t
you understand?—I’m being given lessons in exchange
for those I give myself, and——”</p>

<p>“Lessons! A girl turned seventeen! I call it lamentable.
I’d a-done wud my schooling at twelve.”</p>

<p>“But you know I have to pass an exam....”</p>

<p>“I doan’t see no ‘have’ in it. Better kip at hoame
and help me wud the cooking. Out all day and bring
home no money! I doan’t call that——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off,” said Ivy, getting up and wiping her
mouth. “You two are lik a couple of barndoor cocks,
walking round and round each other. I’ve summat
better to do—I’ve the passage to scrub”—and she took
her sacking apron off the nail.</p>

<p>“Where’s Zacky?” asked Mrs. Beatup. “Has he
started for school?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s gone wud the Sindens.”</p>

<p>“And Harry?”</p>

<p>Ivy laughed. “Oh, Harry’s along of faather, in the
Sunk field—unaccountable good and hard-working to-day,
because Tom’s a-gone; seemingly, he’d sooner please
him now he aun’t here to see than when he was here
fretting his heart out over Harry’s lazy bones.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad as someone remembers my poor boy’s
gone, and is lik to be killed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup’s tears burst out afresh, but Ivy comforted
her with a kiss and a clap and a few cheery words,
and soon had her interested in the various bootstains

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>

on the passage-floor. “Cow-dung, that’s faather; and
horse-dung, that’s Tom; and sheep-dung, that’s Juglery;
and that miry clay’s jest Zacky spannelling....”</p>


<p>2</p>

<p>Nell put on her hat and coat and started for school.
A neat, shabby little figure, with her town hat pulled
down over her soft hair, she walked quickly between
dust-powdered hedges to Brownbread Street, panting a
little, because she was anæmic, and also because she was
still a trifle indignant. Nell did not view life and the
War as her family viewed them. Her different education
had made them not quite such matters of bread-and-cheese.
She alone at Worge had felt the humiliation—as
distinct from the inconvenience—of Tom’s conscription.
She had always despised him because he did not
volunteer during the early stages of the War, and when
the Conscription Act came into force she despised him
still more for his appeal to the Tribunal. She felt that
she could never think proudly of him, knowing how unwillingly
he had gone, knowing that he cared for nothing
except leaving Worge, that he never thought of the great
cause of righteousness he was to fight for, or understood
the mighty issues of his unwilling warfare.</p>

<p>The rest of the family were all of a block. To her
mother the War was merely a matter of prices and scarcities,
to her father it was drink restrictions and the
closing of public-houses, to Ivy it was picture postcards
and boys in khaki, to Harry the unwilling performance
of tasks which would otherwise have been done by more
efficient hands, to Zacky the obscure man&oelig;uvres of a
gang of small boys whose imaginations had been touched
by militarism. To Nell alone belonged the fret and
anxiety of the times, the shock of bad news, the struggle

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>

of ineffectual small labours to win her a place in the
great woe.</p>

<p>To-day she was early for school, as she had meant to
be, for at the church she stopped and sat down in the
porch. St. Wilfred’s, Brownbread Street, was only a
chapel-of-ease under the mother church of Dallington.
It was new-built of sandstone, an unfortunate symbol of
that Rock against which the gates of hell shall not prevail.
The interior, glimpsed through the open door, was
dim and mediæval, the first effect due to the deep tones
of the stained-glass windows, where the saints wore robes
of crimson and sapphire and passional violet, and the
latter to the several dark oil paintings, and the thick gilt
tracery of the screen, through which the altar showed
richly coloured, with one winking red light before it.</p>

<p>The curate-in-charge of Brownbread Street was of
mediæval tendencies, and did his best, both in service
and sermon, to transport his congregation from the woodbine-age
to the age of pilgrimages and monasteries, with
the result that, with unmediæval licence, they sought
illicit and heretical refreshment in Georgian Bethels and
Victorian Tabernacles, where they could sing good Moody
and Sankey tunes, instead of treacherous Gregorians and
wobbling Plainsong.</p>

<p>But Nell loved the low, soft, creeping tones of
Gregory’s mode, loved the dimness, the mystery, the
faint echo of Sarum ... and if in her love was a
personal element which she denied, the church was not
less a refuge from the coarse frustrations of her everyday
life, such as the Forge was to Mr. Sumption and the
Shop had been to Tom.</p>

<p>To-day the priest was at the altar, saying the Last
Gospel. Nell could just see him from where she sat.
He would be out in a couple of minutes. She watched
him glide off into the shadows, then she rose and walked

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

down to the little wicket-gate, where the path from the
porch met the path from the vestry. There was more
colour in her cheeks than usual.</p>

<p>Now and then she looked anxiously across the road at
the schoolhouse clock, where the large hand was creeping
swiftly towards the hour. From the clock her eyes
slewed round to the vestry door. At last the handle
shook, and out came Mr. Poullett-Smith, walking hurriedly,
with his cassock flapping round his legs. He did
not seem to see Nell till he had nearly walked into her.</p>

<p>“Oh—er—good morning, Miss Beatup. I beg your
pardon.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, Mr. Poullett-Smith. I—I wanted to
tell you I’m so sorry I haven’t finished that book you
lent me. I’m afraid I’ve kept it a terrible time.”</p>

<p>Her words came with a rush, blurred faintly in the
last of a Sussex accent, and her eyes were fixed on his
face with an almost childish eagerness which he could
scarcely fail to notice.</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t trouble. Keep the book as long as
you like—the <cite>Sermons of St. Gregory</cite>, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I think they’re wonderful,” breathed Nell,
hoping he would never know how difficult she found them
to understand.</p>

<p>“They are indeed, and so stimulating.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Henry Poullett-Smith was a tall man, with
a long nose, a slight stoop, and a waxy brownish skin
that made him look like one of his own altar candles.
As he spoke to Nell, he kept on glancing up the street,
and when a girl on a bicycle came round the corner, he
moved a few steps out into the road and took off his hat.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Miss Lamb.”</p>

<p>Marian Lamb, who was in Red Cross uniform, jumped
off her bicycle and shook hands with him before she
shook hands with Nell Beatup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“On your way to the hospital, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m on morning duty this week.”</p>

<p>“Do you prefer that to the afternoons?”</p>

<p>“Not in summer. I do in winter, though.”</p>

<p>Nell felt ignored and insulted. She made no effort to
join in this sprightly dialogue. There was something in
the curate’s manner towards the other girl which seemed
to stab her through with a sense of her inferiority, with
memories of the coarse, muddling life of Worge to which
she belonged. It was not that he showed more courtesy,
but he seemed to show more freedom ... he was more
at his ease with one of his own class.</p>

<p>Her cheeks burned. Of course she was not his equal.
He might talk to her and lend her books, but he did it
only out of kindness; probably looked upon it as a
superior form of parish relief—doled the books as he
doled blankets.... She shrugged away, and the movement
made him at once turn to her with a remark:</p>

<p>“Have you been over the hospital, Miss Beatup?”</p>

<p>“No—I’ve never had time ... and I must hurry off
now. Good morning!”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke she noticed that her voice was thick
and drawly, unlike Miss Lamb’s sharp, clear tones. She
gripped her satchel and hurried across the road to the
schoolhouse.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>During the next few days the most remarkable sight
at Worge was Harry’s industriousness. For nearly a
week he rose at five, fed the pigs and helped with the
milking, and during the whole day he was available for
carting, digging, dunging, or anything else he had formerly
fled from. He helped Elphick spray the young
fuggles down by Forges and the Sunk Field, he took a
cartload of roots over to Three Cups Corner, he groomed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>

the horses and plaited their manes, he compelled Zacky
with threats of personal violence to spend Saturday afternoon
scaring birds from the gooseberries, instead of, with
six other little boys, carrying out an enveloping movement
on Punnetts Town, with three-ha’pence to spend on
sweets in the captured citadel. On the occasion of Mus’
Beatup’s next lapse, he stalled the cows and doctored the
mare, and also, with much foresight, took off and hid his
father’s boots, which prevented both his going to bed in
them and his throwing them at his wife.</p>

<p>It would have been well if this virtuous state could
have lasted till the hay harvest. This was early, for
there was a spell of heat in May, and the fields were soon
parched. The air was full of the smell of ripe hayseed,
of the baking glumes of the oats, of the hot, sickly stew
of elderflower and meadowsweet. Along the Four
Roads eddies of dust flew from under the wheels and
caked the grass and fennel-heads beside the way, and in
the ruts of the little lanes the bennet and rest-barrow
sprouted, with the thick-stalked sprawly pignut, and
ragged robin. Unfortunately, all this scent and heat made
Harry remember a wood over by Cade Street, where he
had once lain and watched the moon rise rusty beyond
Lobden’s House. It was unfortunate that he had such
a memory, for it had more than once been his undoing.
Somewhere under Harry’s skin, mixed with the sluggish
currents of his country blood, was a strain of poetry and
imagination. He cared nothing for books, nothing for
beauty, nothing for music (except, perhaps, when they
sang “Diadem” in the Bethel at dusk), and yet every
now and then something would pull him from the earth
he toiled on—a thing he was unaware of three weeks out
of the four, seeing only the sods cleaving together—something
would call him from meadow-hills that swept
up their broomy cones to the sky, an adventure would

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>

call from the Four Roads, a longing would call from the
moon ... and off he would go to Stunts Green, to
Starnash, Oxbottom’s Town, or Burnt Kitchen—just as,
after a sober week, Mus’ Beatup would go off to the
Rifle Volunteer.</p>

<p>His promise to Tom had made him resist the cruder
temptations of ratting Sindens or bird’s-nesting Kadwells;
but now it seemed to pull the other way. His
brother was the only person he was in any degree afraid
of, and he was safe at Waterheel, no longer his father’s
vicar, waiting with barnyard discipline for the truant’s
return.</p>

<p>So Harry went off to that wood at Cade Street, and
spent the night there, in a hollow tree, watching the big
yellow stars shuddering above the ash-boughs like
candles in the wind, and sleeping with his head in a soft
mush of last year’s leaves, that sent him back with his
cheeks all smeary, and his hair caked with leaf-mast.</p>

<p>That was the day of the haycutting, when Mus’ Beatup
and Juglery and Elphick sweated with bent backs in the
field. Worge possessed a horse-rake, but the cutting had
all to be done by hand, and the men’s backs ached and
scorched in the sun, and their sweat dropped on their
scythes. This labour, as was only natural, started in
Mus’ Beatup a fearful thirst, and that night was “one
of his bad nights”—one of the worst, in fact, for he
threw the candlestick at his wife as well as his boots,
and would not let her come to bed, so that she had to
sleep with Ivy and Nell.</p>

<p>Harry felt rather ashamed, and tried hard to atone the
next day by working himself sick. Mrs. Beatup and Ivy
helped too, since haymaking was the one kind of field
work which the women did not feel it derogatory to
perform. Ivy was a whacking girl, nearly as good as a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>

man; but Mus’ Beatup would never have dreamed of
asking her to help fill Tom’s empty place. If town girls
thought so little of themselves as to enrol for farm work,
that was no concern of his, but he was hemmed if he’d
have his wife and daughter meddling with anything beyond
the fowl-house, and as for employing other women
whose dignity mattered less to him—and, apparently, to
themselves—he’d sooner Worge went to the auctioneer’s,
just to teach the government a lesson.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>So Worge muddled through its haymaking, and then
the shearing; and Harry was sometimes idle and sometimes
industrious, and Mus’ Beatup was sometimes drunk
and sometimes sober. The oats in the Street Field and
the field at the back of the Rifle Volunteer were slowly
parching to the colour of dust, though thick green
shadows rippled in them, and told how far off still the
harvest was. They were spring-sown potato-oats, chosen
by Tom on account of their vigorous constitution, though
otherwise not very well suited to the clays of Sunday
Street. He had manured them at their sowing with rape-cake,
nursed their first sproutings, and now in every letter
enquired after their progress. “Keep an eye on them,
dear father, for the Lord’s sake, and do not let them stand
after they’re ripe, or they will shed there seeds for certain
sure, being potatos.”</p>

<p>Tom had been some weeks now at Waterheel in the
Midlands, a private in the Sussex Regiment, with an
elaborate and mystifying address, which his family found
the greatest difficulty in cramming into the envelope.
They did not write to him as often as he wrote to them,
in spite of the fact that they were six to one. But then
they were not far from home, dreaming of the old fields,
longing for the old faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole though, Tom was happy enough. He
found his new life strange, but not totally uncongenial.
A comfortable want of imagination made it possible for
him to put Worge out of mind, now that it was also out
of sight, and he was among lads of his own age, old
acquaintances some of them—Kadwell of Stilliands
Tower, and two Viners from Satanstown, Bill Putland,
Jerry Sumption. There was Mus’ Archie, too, with a
nod and a kind word now and then to intensify that
“feeling of Sussex chaps” which was not quite such an
uncommon one now; and there was Mus’ Dixon, Mus’
Archie’s elder brother, who had lived in London and
written for the papers before the War, and now used his
sword to cut the leaves of books—so his orderly said—yet
was a brave man none the less, and a good officer,
though he hated the life as much as his brother
loved it.</p>

<p>The family at Worge were surprised to find that Tom’s
best pal was Bill Putland. In Sunday Street he had had
very little to do with the Squire’s cheeky chauffeur, and
there had always been a gnawing rivalry between Egypt
and Worge. But now that they had joined up together,
and been drafted into the same company, sharing the
same awkwardness and fumblings, a friendship sprang
up between them, and thrived in the atmosphere of their
common life. Putland was a much smarter recruit than
Beatup, but this did not cause ill-feeling, for Bill did
much to help Tom, passing on to him the tips he picked
up so much more quickly than his friend, with the result
that Tom got through the mangold-wurzel stage sooner
than Mus’ Archie had expected. Tom on his side was
humbly conscious of Bill’s superiority. “He’s been bred
up different from us,” he wrote home to Worge.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>

“You can see that by the way he talks and everything, and
he’s a sharper chap than me by a long chalk. But he’s
unaccountable good-hearted, and he helps me with my
leathers after he’s done his own, for he’s a sight quicker
than me.”</p>

<p>Tom more often asked for news than he gave it.
After all, life at Waterheel Camp did not consist of much
besides drills and route-marchings, with relaxations at
the Y.M.C.A. hut, and occasional visits to the town.
No one at Worge would care to hear the daily doings of
such a life, and still less were they likely to understand
it. He was uneasily conscious of what his father would
say about these things at the Rifle Volunteer. “Took
my boy away from his honest work, and all they do is to
keep him forming fours and traipsing about the country
and playing dominoes at the Y.M.C.A. That’s wot the
Governmunt spends our money on,” etc., etc. And Tom
was now soldier enough to resent any criticism of the
Army from outside it.</p>

<p>In other quarters though, it appeared he was not so
reticent. After a while his family discovered that Thyrza
Honey was hearing from him pretty regularly. Moreover,
one day Mrs. Beatup, buying candles, found Thyrza
wearing a regimental button mounted as a brooch, and
was told it was a gift from Tom.</p>

<p>“He’s sweet on her,” said Ivy, when the news was
told.</p>

<p>“Him—he’s just a bit of a boy,” said his mother.</p>

<p>“The Army maakes men unaccountable sudden.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, she’s four years older than he is, and
wot he can see in her is more’n I can say.”</p>

<p>“She’s got a bit o’ money though,” said Mus’ Beatup.
“I shan’t put a spoke in his wheel if he wants to marry
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Him marry! Wot are you thinking of, Ned? He’s
only a bit of a boy, as I’ve told you. Besides, she aun’t
got no looks; she’s just a plain dump of a woman, and
a boy liks a pretty faace.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Honey’s middling pretty,” said Ivy, “with
colour and teeth and all.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got queer notions of pretty. Why, only yesterday
Mrs. Sinden wur saying to me as she can’t think
wot Sam Honey ever saw in Thyrza Shearne. And you
can’t git naun out of her, she’s slow as a cow, and she
looks at you lik a cow chewing the cud....”</p>

<p>Nell broke in—</p>

<p>“You’re all taking it for granted that Mrs. Honey
would have Tom if she was given the chance. Maybe
he’d be quite safe even if he asked her.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my girl,” cried Mus’ Beatup. “A woman
ud taake any man as wur fool enough to ask her; if a
woman’s unwed you may reckon she’s never been asked.”</p>

<p>Ivy laughed loudly at this, and Nell turned crimson.</p>

<p>“Women aren’t going quite so cheap as you think.”</p>

<p>“Oh, aun’t they!—when it’s bin proved as there’s
twice as many of ’em as there’s men. I tell you, when
there’s a glut of turnips, the price goes down.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t twice as many women as men. Miss
Goldsack was saying only the other day that——”</p>

<p>“And I tell you it’s bin proved as there are, and when
the War’s over there’ll be more still, and they’ll be going
about weeping and hollering and praying to the men to
taake them.”</p>

<p>“They won’t. They’ll have something better to do.
This War’s teaching women to work, and——”</p>

<p>“Work! I wudn’t give a mouldy onion fur women’s
work....”</p>

<p>And so on, and so on.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Thyrza herself was a little surprised to hear so often
from Tom, and the brooch was a piece of daring she had
never expected. It is true that from time to time she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>

sent him presents of chocolate and cigarettes, but his
letters were much more than an acknowledgment of these.
They were not love-letters, but Thyrza knew that they
contained more confidences than those he sent to Worge—she
was familiar with all the common round of his
day, from rêveille to lights-out. He told her about the
men he liked and those he didn’t, about his drills and
fatigues, about his food and Cookie’s queer notions of a
stew—Thyrza knew what was an “army biscuit,” a
“choky,” a “gor’ blimey,” and the number of stripes
worn respectively by “God Almighty,” “swank” and
“goat.” Scarcely a week passed without one of those
thin yellowish envelopes, with the red triangle in the corner,
slipping under the shop door—addressed in smeary,
indelible pencil, and smelling of woodbines.</p>

<p>She noticed a growing assurance in his style—partly
due, perhaps, to the friendliness of her replies, partly,
no doubt, to the growing manhood in him. She had
always looked on Tom as a kind, slow chap, with very
little to say for himself, and not too much thinking going
on either, but with an unaccountable good heart. Now
she realised that the Army was smartening him up, giving
him confidence, enlarging his ideas. Thyrza was only
a countrywoman herself, born within ten miles of where
she lived now, but she did not fail to notice or to respect
this growth in Tom. “He’s gitting new ideas in his
head, and he’s waking up a bit. I shan’t lik him the less
for being readier wud his tongue, surelye.”</p>

<p>One of the new ideas which got into Tom’s head at
Waterheel was the desirability—indeed, the urgency—of
having a “girl.” All the chaps had girls—Bill Putland
wrote to Polly Sinden at Little Worge, though he
had taken very little notice of her while he was at home;
Jerry Sumption wrote half-threatening, half-appealing
scrawls to Ivy Beatup; Kadwell and Viner had sweethearts

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>

at the Foul Mile and the Trulilows—every evening
at the Y.M.C.A. a hundred indelible pencils travelled
to and fro from tongue to paper in the service of that god
who campaigns with the god of war, and occasionally
snatches his victories. There was also the need to
receive letters—a need which Tom had never felt before,
but now ached in his breast, when at post-time he saw
other men walk away tearing envelopes, while he stood
empty-handed. Thyrza wrote more often and more fully
than his mother, and he would answer quickly, to make
her write again. So closer and closer between them was
drawn that link of smudged envelopes and ruled note-paper,
with their formalities of “Your letter received
quite safe,” and “Hoping this finds you well, as it leaves
me at present”—till the chain was forged which should
bind them for ever.</p>

<p>Thyrza pondered this in her heart. She was used to
much indefinite courtship, most of it just before lamp-time
in her own little shop, with the prelude of a “penn’orth
of bull’s-eyes for the children” or “a packet of
Player’s, please.” She had also been definitely courted
once or twice in her short widowhood—by Bourner of
the Forge, a widower with five sturdy children, and
Hearsfield of Mystole. She was a type of girl who, while
appealing little to her fellow-women, who “never cud see
naun in Thyrza Honey,” yet had a definite attraction for
men, by reason of that same softness and slowness for
which her own sex despised her. She had no particular
wish to marry again, and at the same time no particular
objection. Her first marriage had not been so happy as
to make her anxious to repeat it, but it had also lacked
those elements of degradation which make a woman
shrink from trusting herself a second time to a master.
There was too much business and too much gossip in her
life for her to feel her loneliness as a widow, and yet she

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>

sometimes craved for the little child which had died at
birth two years ago—she “cud do wud a child,” she sometimes
said.</p>

<p>Tom Beatup attracted her strongly. He was much her
own type—slow, ruminative and patient as the beasts he
tended—yet she saw him as a being altogether more helpless
than herself, one less able to think and plan, one
whom she could “manage” tenderly. He was not so
practical as she, and more in need of affection, of which
he got less. Thyrza sometimes pictured his round dark
head upon her breast, her arm about him, holding him
there in the crook of it, both lover and child....</p>

<p>From the material point of view, the match was not
a good one; but Thyrza was comfortably off, and her
miniature trade was brisk. They were both too unsophisticated
to make a barrier of her little stock of
worldly goods—he had his pay, so his independence
would not suffer, and she would have a separation
allowance into the bargain. He was a slow wooer, and
the tides of his boldness had never risen again to the
level of that sticky kiss he had given her hand as she
served the bull’s-eyes—but she was sure of him, and,
being Thyrza, “slow as a cow,” had no objection to
waiting.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Another woman in Sunday Street was being courted
from the Waterheel Y.M.C.A., but she did not fill her
part as comfortably as Thyrza. Not that Ivy Beatup
had much real concern for Jerry Sumption’s passion,
beating against her indifference as a wave beats and
breaks against a rock. Her chief trouble was that Jerry
now threw out hints of an approaching leave, and though
she had no objection to his mingling rage and tenderness

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>

on paper, she disliked the thought of having to confront
them mingled in his gipsy face.</p>

<p>The minister’s son was one of Ivy’s mistakes—she
made mistakes occasionally, as she would herself
acknowledge with a good-humoured grin. But they were
never very serious. And, as the saying is, she knew how
to take care of herself. Unfortunately, Jerry had given
her more than ordinary trouble. After some years of
standoffishness and suspicion—for Mrs. Beatup had
never liked her children to play with the gipsy woman’s
son—Ivy and Jerry had somehow been thrown together
during his last holiday from Erith, and she had good-naturedly
allowed him to kiss her and take her to Senlac
Fair, as she would have allowed any decent lad on leave.
It was unlucky that what had been to her no more than
a bit of fun should be for Jerry the tinder to set his body
and soul alight. Ivy, more buxom than beautiful, and,
with her apple-face and her barley-straw hair, typical of
those gaujos his mother’s people had always distrusted,
somehow became his earth and sky. He loved her, and
went after her as the tide after the moon.</p>

<p>Ivy tried to detach him by the various means known
to her experience. For a long time she ignored his letters
and postcards. Then when these continued to pour upon
her, she sent a cold, careless reply, which had the contrary
effect of making his furnace seven times hotter;
so that her next letter was warmed unconsciously by
the flame of his, and she saw that instead of having
shaken him off, she had gone a step further in his
company.</p>

<p>No doubt the best thing to do was to tell him to his
face that she would not have him. He would not be the
first chap she had told this, but Ivy had an unaccountable
shrinking from repeating the process with Jerry.
There was in him a subtle essence, a mystifying quality—perhaps
it was no more than the power of a sharper

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

life and death—which made him different from the other
lads she knew, and struck terror into her country soul.
He was the first man she had been ever so little afraid of.
Ivy had the least imagination of all the Beatups. That
spark which sent Nell to the church, and Harry to the
woods, which made Tom feel more than roots and clay
in the earth on which he trod, and Zacky sometimes
almost think himself a British army corps, even that
little spark had never flickered up in Ivy’s honest heart.
Her world was made of things she could taste and see
and hear and smell and handle, and very good things she
found them. She resented the presence in her life of
something which responded to none of these tests.
Jerry’s love for her was “queer,” just as Jerry himself
was “queer,” and Ivy did not like “queer” things.</p>

<p>When the long-dreaded leave came at last, it took her
by surprise. She had not heard from Jerry for a week,
and one morning, having run to the pillar-box at the
throws, with some letters for her soldier friends, on her
return she met Mr. Sumption, waving his arms and
cracking his joints and shouting to her even from beyond
earshot, that Jerry was coming home that evening.</p>

<p>“A letter came this morning. Maybe you’ve got one
too?”</p>

<p>Ivy shook her head, and Mr. Sumption tried to disguise
his pleasure at being the only one to hear.</p>

<p>“He’s a good boy, Jerry—never forgets his father.
But he wants to see you though, Ivy. Maybe you’d come
and have supper with us this evening?”</p>

<p>“I’m unaccountable sorry, but I’m going up to Senlac
town.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s a pity. Perhaps you’ll come another day?”</p>

<p>“If I’ve time, Mus’ Sumption—but I’m justabout
vrothered these days wud the harvesters here. Thank
you kindly though, all the same.”</p>

<p>She had been sidling away as she spoke, and now
walked off with a brisk “Good mornun.” She was
sorry to have to disappoint Mr. Sumption, whom she
liked and pitied; but there was no good letting him
think she had any use for Jerry.</p>

<p>Before going home she ran down the drive to Little
Worge, and told Polly Sinden she was at all costs and
risks to come with her to Senlac that evening.</p>

<p>For the rest of the day she was less her cheery, placid
self than usual, and the evening in Senlac town was not
the treat it might have been. All the time she was
haunted by a sense of Jerry’s nearness—perhaps he had
come as far as Lewes by now, perhaps he was already in
Sunday Street, perhaps in Senlac itself. What a fool
she had been to tell Mr. Sumption where she was going!
Her heart was troubled—another of those “queer”
aspects of the situation which she so disliked. Generally
when she wanted to get rid of a boy, she did not have
feelings like these. All through the soft August twilight,
when she and Polly Sinden, in the clumsy finery of
country girls, strolled arm-in-arm up and down the
Upper Lake and the Lower Lake—those two lakes of
blood which an old, old war had made, giving the town
its bloody name—and even afterwards, when having by
arts known to themselves acquired two soldiers, they
sat in the picture palace with a khaki arm round each
tumbled muslin waist, even then the terror lingered,
haunting, tearing, elusive as a dead leaf on the wind.
Ivy looked nervously into the shadows of the little picture-hall,
thinking she saw Jerry’s face, angry and
swarthy, with eyes like the Forge at night.... Suppose
he had come after her to Senlac ... he certainly
would if he was home in time. Then came a picture of a
girl who was “done in” by her lover. Ivy could stand it
no more, and rising to her feet, plunged out over the
people’s knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“That plaace is lik an oven,” she said to the Anzac
corporal who followed her out.... “No, thank you.
I’ll go home wud Polly.”</p>

<p>Polly was a little annoyed that Ivy should have broken
up the party so soon; but it certainly was very hot—both
the girls’ faces were spotted with sweat and their
gowns were sticking to their shoulders. Besides, it would
be as well not to get too thick with this Australian chap
now Bill Putland was writing so regularly.... Miss
Sinden and Miss Beatup dismissed their escort, and, after
the proper number of “Good-by-ees,” shouted across
longer and longer darkness-muffled distances, they
trudged off homewards on the North Trade.</p>

<p>When Ivy reached the farm, she was told that Jerry
Sumption had called about eight o’clock—on his way
from the station, without even going first to leave his
kit-bag at the Horselunges—and that Mrs. Beatup had
had an unaccountable to-do to git shut of him.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Having made up her mind that a meeting was inevitable,
Ivy made no more efforts to avoid one. By her
absence on his first visit she had clearly shown Jerry how
matters stood, and if he was fool enough to come
again....</p>

<p>He was, of course. Ivy, unromantically on her knees
at her usual business of scrubbing the kitchen boards,
felt no annoyance at being so discovered, made no hasty
grabs at her rolled-up sleeves, or at the loosening knob
of her hair. She would not have done so for a more
favoured lover, for none of her courtships had been of
the kind that encourages neatness and daintiness in a
woman, that leads to curlings and powderings. She
knew that men liked her for her youth and health and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>

bigness, for her cheeriness and strength, and as all these
things were natural to her she had no need to trouble
herself with fakes.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Jerry,” she said, without looking up, and sending
a swirl of soapy water round his boots.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Ivy. Why weren’t you in when I came last
night?”</p>

<p>“Because I’d gone into Senlac wud Polly Sinden, as
your father ud have told you, if you’d done wot you
should ought and gone to him fust.”</p>

<p>“You’d no call to go into Senlac—not on the first night
of my leave.”</p>

<p>“Your leave doan’t matter to me.”</p>

<p>“Ivy....”</p>

<p>He caught her wrist as she was dipping the scrubbing-brush
in the bucket, and she was forced to meet his eyes
at last. She had tried to avoid this, staring at her soapsuds,
for Jerry’s eyes were “queer.”
“Leave hold of me, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Not till you stand up and look at me. I can’t speak
to you on all fours like this.”</p>

<p>Ivy stood up, rather wondering at Jerry’s power to
make her do so. He was a small fellow, but not of the
stubby built of Tom or Harry Beatup. On the contrary,
he was lightly made as a dancing-master, his hands and
feet were small but very strong, his face was small and
brown, lit by two large sloe-black eyes, with lashes long
and curly as a child’s. His hair was curly too, in spite
of its military cropping. He was a most slovenly-looking
soldier, with tunic stained and buttons dim, and puttees
looping grotesquely round his slim, graceful legs.</p>

<p>“If the M.P.’s git hold of you ...” began Ivy
jeeringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“There ain’t any M.P.’s hereabouts. I’m on my leave,
and you’re starting to spoil it already.”</p>

<p>“Wot have I got to do wud your leave? You’re
maaking some sort gurt big mistaake, Jerry Sumption.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ve forgotten that day at Senlac Fair?”</p>

<p>“And if I have, wot matter? It meant naun. You
aun’t the fust lad that’s kissed me, nor the last, nuther.”</p>

<p>It hurt her to have to speak so plainly, but Jerry
Sumption must be put right at once on one or two important
matters he seemed to have misunderstood. She
saw his face go pale under its sunburn and she felt sorry
for him. None the less, she stuck to her harshness.</p>

<p>“I likked you well enough, and I lik you still; but if
you think as I meant more’n I did or said, you’re unaccountable
mistaaken.”</p>

<p>“Ivy—come out of doors with me. I can’t speak to
you in here. When my heart’s full I want the wind
blowing round me.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “No, Jerry; we’ll stay where
we are, surelye. You’re hedge-born, but I’m house-born,
and I lik four walls around me when I’m vrothered.
Now, lad, doan’t that show you as we two cud never
mate?”</p>

<p>“So, I’m vrothering you, am I?”</p>

<p>“Unaccountable.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I didn’t vrother you when I clipped you in
the lane by the stack of Slivericks.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t ’ee....”</p>

<p>His strange power over her was coming back. Looking
into his eyes she seemed to see strange secrets of
woods, memories of roads and stars, and a light that was
like the light of a burning wood, such as she had once
seen, licking up from the west, burning the little farm
and the barns. She was frightened of Jerry, just as she
was frightened of Dallington churchyard at night, or
that field-corner by Padgham, where strange lights are
sometimes seen. Yet it was a fear which instead of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>

making her run, made her stumble and droop towards
him, seeking refuge from terror in its source....</p>

<p>He pushed her away.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ll be kissing another lad to-night.”</p>

<p>She felt flustered and miserable.</p>

<p>“You’re a lamentable trial to me, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“Why? ’Cos I’ve kissed you? It’s nothing. I’ll be
kissing another girl to-night.”</p>

<p>“You’re a valiant feller.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t I? You think the world of me, Ivy Beatup.”</p>

<p>“Do I? That’s news. Now doan’t start it all over
again. I hear mother coming.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup’s step creaked outside, and Jerry scowled
at the door. The next moment he was astride the
window-sill, a queer furtive look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You aun’t going out lik that, surelye! I’m ashamed
of you. Stay and spik to mother like a Christian.”</p>

<p>But he had swung his leg over, and slid into the yard.
She heard him run off, with padding footsteps like a
beast.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>The next day was Sunday. A thick yellow haze swam
over the fields, and there was a faint autumnal scent in
the hedges, mixed of leaves and earth. The grain-fields
still smelt of summer, with the baking glumes and the
white, cracked ground. Only a few had been cut—the
winter sowings at Egypt and Bucksteep; the Volunteer
Field and the Street Field at Worge still carried their
crops, chaffy and nutty, preyed on by conies. They
should have been cut last week, but Mus’ Beatup had
not been himself on Friday and Saturday, and Juglery
had a bad leg, and Harry had gone to Hailsham Fair.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o’clock church and chapel goers began
to dribble down the lane to Brownbread Street, while a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>

few strayed into the Bethel, which looked a little less
gaunt with its door open to the sunshine and old Grandfather
Hubble sitting in it with the collecting-plate on
his knees. The congregation was small, but bigger than
the Particular Baptist sect in Sunday Street. There
were actually only two received members—old Hubble
and his daughter-in-law; the rest were either members
of other denominations who had quarrelled with their
respective chapels, or else felt disinclined for the trudge
into Brownbread Street. Bourner came because the minister
had once been a blacksmith, and the farmer of
Puddledock came because he had once cured a stallion
of his that had lockjaw.</p>

<p>Jerry Sumption came because he hoped Ivy Beatup
would be there. It was a vain hope, for on fine Sundays
the family at Worge always went to church—except,
of course, Mus’ Beatup, whose scientific readings had
taught him the folly of all churches, and Mrs. Beatup,
who stayed at home to cook the dinner. However,
Mr. Sumption had encouraged, if indeed he had not inspired,
the illusion which landed Jerry in one of the big
back pews of the Bethel, a pew like a dusty box, smelling
of wood-rot. He knew that if he had been more candid
Jerry would have padded off over the fields to Brownbread
Street and drunk in pernicious heresies of Infant
Baptism and Universal Redemption, while he stared at
his sweetheart’s profile ruddy in the sunshine which
glowed on her through some painted saint. So he concealed
the fact that the Beatups were “Church,” weather
permitting, and allowed Jerry to think he would have Ivy
to grin and blink at during the sermon, as on his last
visit, when the rain was tinkling in the chapel gutters.</p>

<p>Finding himself sold, Jerry was inclined to sulk.
Luckily he did not suspect his father, or he would have
got up and walked out. The service was nearly half

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>

finished before he gave up hope; that is to say, the
sermon had begun, and the congregation had subsided
into its various compartments, so that anyone coming
in would have seen no one but Mr. Sumption, like a big
crow in his Sunday blacks, shouting from the pulpit at
two rows of coffin-like pews. Jerry opened the door of
his, so that he could look out of the chapel door, which
stood open, and see the dull blue sky above the fields of
Puddledock, and in the foreground the neglected churchyard
of the Bethel, with the tombstones leaning this way
and that.</p>

<p>A heavy sickness of heart fell on him, sitting there in
the rot-smelling pew, with his arms folded over his chest
and his shoulders shrugged to his ears. He felt caught
in his love for Ivy Beatup like an animal in a trap,
frantic, struggling, wounding himself with his struggles.
If she did not want him, why wouldn’t she let him go?...
Lord! he would never forget her that day at Senlac
Fair, with her cheeks red as the pimpernel and her eyes
like the big twilight stars, and her hair blowing about
them as they kissed.... If she had not meant it,
why had she done it? If she had not wanted his heart,
why had she taken it and bruised it so? He did not
please her. Why? He had pleased other girls; and
now he was in uniform ... that ought to please her.
He remembered how she had made him jealous when
she spoke of her soldier friends. Well, now he was a
soldier too—leading a damned life partly for her sake
... that ought to please her.</p>

<p>In the Bethel yard rank weeds were growing, clumping
round the tombstones, thickening the grass with
their fat stalks and wide milk-bleeding leaves. They
were hot in the sun, and the smell of them crept into the
Bethel and found its place in the miasma of wood-rot
and Sunday clothes and plaster and stale lamp-oil ...

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>

the smell of pignut stewing in the sun, of the burdock
and the thick fog-weed, the plantain, the nettle, the
dandelion. The chapel weeds seemed to give Jerry an
answer to his question. He did not please Ivy because
he was the gipsy-woman’s son, no less a weed because
he grew in a chapel yard. The hedge-born could not
please the house-born, as she had said—though for that
matter he had been born in a bed like any Christian,
in that little room above the Forge at Bethersden, which
he could dimly remember, with its view down three cross-roads.</p>

<p>He clenched his small hard fists, and stared scowling
out towards the sun-swamped fields of the horizon. He
would punish Ivy Beatup for her cruelty, for having
trodden on the chapel weed. He would make her suffer—if
he could, for she was tough and lusty as an oak. He
found himself hating her for her sturdy cheerfulness—for
the shape of her face, with the hard, round cheeks
and pointed chin—for her lips which were warm when
her heart was cold....</p>

<p>A loud thump on the pulpit woke him out of his
thoughts. His father had noticed his abstraction for
some time, and chose this way of rousing him. From
his vantage he could see into all the separate cells of his
congregation, and if he noticed anyone nodding or mooning
or reading his Bible for solace, he made haste to recall
him to a proper sense of his surroundings. He now
stopped in the middle of an eschatological trump and
glared at Jerry with his bright, tragic eyes. He had a
habit of drastic personal dealings with his flock, to which,
perhaps, its small size was due. Certainly Ades of Cowlease
had never entered the Bethel door since Mr. Sumption
had “thumped” at him, and one or two others had
been driven away in a like manner. To-day everyone,
even those whose heads did not pop out of their

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>

pews like Jim-Crows, guessed that the minister had
“thumped” at Jerry, for the minister’s Jerry seldom
came through a service without being thumped at—luckily
he did not much mind it. “W’oa—old ’un,” he
mumbled to himself, as he met his father’s stare, and
soon luckily came the hymn: “They shall gather by
the river,” which Jerry sang most tunefully, in a loud,
sweet, not quite human voice, forgetting all those sad
thoughts of the chapel weed....</p>

<p>But he remembered them when he was walking across
to the Horselunges with his father.</p>

<p>“Father, if I can’t get Ivy Beatup, I’ll kill myself.”</p>

<p>“For shame, you ungodly boy—to speak so light of
losing your salvation!”</p>

<p>“Would I lose my salvation if I killed myself?”</p>

<p>“Reckon you would. Satan would get you at once.”</p>

<p>“I’ll kill her, then. Satan can have her and welcome.”</p>

<p>“It’s you he’d have if you killed her.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s got me both ways?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he has, you sinful good-for-nothing, dreaming
in sermon-time. Have done, do, with your idle talk,
or Satan will get me too, and make me give you a kick
behind.”</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>Jerry’s leave was not a happy or a peaceful one—no
more for his father and Ivy Beatup than for himself.
Every day he was over at Worge—Ivy had never met
anyone so undetachable. She hated herself, too, for
some temporary capitulations. Jerry had a way of
making her faint-hearted, so that she would be betrayed
into a kiss, or even a visit to the Pictures, with an
entwined walk home under the stars. She wished that
some other boy—some young Pix or Viner or Kadwell—was
home on leave, then she might have escaped to him

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>

from Jerry. Not that she really doubted herself—she
had made up her mind that she did not want him and
that she would not have him; this still held good, and
her momentary lapses deceived neither her nor him. He
no longer wooed her ardently—contrariwise, he was stiff
and sulky, sullen and rough when he kissed her. He
knew that there was no chance for him, that his only prey
could be the present moment, which he snatched and
despised.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption, after one or two abortive attempts at
persuading Ivy to take his boy, tried to detach Jerry
from the vain quest which was spoiling these precious
days.</p>

<p>“There’s many another girl that would have you,
Jerry—and a better match, too, for a clergyman’s son.”</p>

<p>“I know there is—and I’ve had ’em—and thrown ’em
away again. She’s the only one I’ve ever wanted for
keeps.”</p>

<p>When he heard this, Mr. Sumption felt as if his heart
would break.</p>

<p>At last came the end of Jerry’s leave. It was starless
dusk, with clouds swagging on the thundery wind. Pools
and spills of white light came from the west, making the
fields look ghostly in the dripping swale. At Worge a
scent of withering corn-stalks came from the fields where
the crops had been cut at last, and as Jerry stood in the
doorway the first dead leaves of the year fell on his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“Come out with me, Ivy. It’s for the last time, and
I hate your kitchen with the ceiling on my head, and
your mother spannelling round.”</p>

<p>Ivy was in a good humour. The joy of freedom was
already upon her—she felt confident, and knew that
there would be no lapses this evening. So she put a
shawl over her head and went out with him. They

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

passed through the yard and the orchard into the grass-fields
by Forges Wood.</p>

<p>The field was tangled and soggy, full of coarse, sour
grass. In the dip of it, by the wood’s edge, toadstools
spread dim tents, or squashed invisibly underfoot, as
the twilight drank up all colours save white and grey.</p>

<p>“I’ve trod on a filthy toadstool, and my foot’s all
over scum,” said Ivy, rubbing her shoe in the grass.
“Let’s git through the hëadge, Jerry, into the dry
stubble.”</p>

<p>“This is a better place to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>“We’ll say good-bye in the house. Now, none of your
nonsense, Jerry Sumption”—as he put his arm round her
waist.</p>

<p>“But it’s my last evening.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve come for a walk. Wot more d’you want?
I’m naun for cuddling, if that’s wot you’re after. I’ll
give you a kiss, full and fair, when we say good-bye in
the house, but there’s to be no lovering under hëadges.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been unkind all along. You’ve spoilt my
leave.”</p>

<p>“That’s your own fault, surelye. I’ve bin straight
wud you.”</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly. Then his laugh broke into a gipsy
whine.</p>

<p>“Ivy, are you sure—quite sure you’ll never love me?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure—as I’ve told you a dunnamany times.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t mean now ... some day ... Ivy?”</p>

<p>In the dusk his face showed white as the toadstools at
her feet, but she stood firm, for his sake as well as her
own.</p>

<p>“It’s no use talking about ‘some day’—I tell you
it’s never.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“Never!—and you’ve let me hold you and kiss
you....”</p>

<p>“Only now and then—saum as I’d let any nice lad.”</p>

<p>His eyes blazed.</p>

<p>“You little bitch!”</p>

<p>“Mind your words, my boy—and leave hoald of my
arm, and come into the next field, or I’ll git hoame.”</p>

<p>But he did not move, and his grip on her arm
tightened.</p>

<p>“I want you. I reckon you don’t know what that
means when I say I want you, or you wouldn’t be so
damn cruel. Ivy, I can’t leave you like this. I can’t
go back to camp knowing I’m just nothing to you. You
must give me some sort of hope. It’s not fair to have
led me on——”</p>

<p>“I never led you on——”</p>

<p>Her limbs were shaking. An unaccountable terror had
seized her—a terror of him, with his hot, gripping hand
and blazing eyes, of the field so dim and sour, its grass
scummy with the spilth of trampled toadstools, of the
wood close by with its spindled ashes and clumping
oaks....</p>

<p>“Let me go!” she cried suddenly, in a weak frightened
voice.</p>

<p>For answer he pulled her into his arms, and held her
with her breast bruised against his.</p>

<p>“I shan’t let you go—I’ll never let you go. Come
into the wood, Ivy. Don’t be afraid ... I love you....
Come into the wood—there’s nothing to be afraid
of. I wouldn’t hurt you for worlds.”</p>

<p>He tried to pick her up and carry her, but she struggled
desperately and broke free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“This has justabout finished it all, Jerry Sumption.
You’re a beast—I’ll never let you come nigh me agaun.
You’ve a-done for yourself. I’ve bin good to you and
straight wud you, and I’d have gone on being friends;
but now I’ve a-done wud you for good.”</p>

<p>Her voice broke with rage, and she turned to run home.
But he grabbed her again, and this time she could not
escape. He was a small man, and she was a big whacking
girl; but madness was in him, and his arms were
like iron clamps.</p>

<p>“You shan’t get shut of me like that. I tell you I
mean to have you ... and wot’s more I’ll make you
have me. I’ll break your pride—I’ll make you want to
have me, ask me to take you.”</p>

<p>Ivy screamed.</p>

<p>“Scream away. No one ull hear. I’ve got you, and
I’m damned if I let you go till I please.... To-morrow
you’ll be on your knees, begging me to take you and
save you.”</p>

<p>He clapped his hand over her mouth, and forced back
her head, kissing her strained and aching neck till she
screamed with pain as well as with fright. Her cries
were stilled under his palm, her head swam, her strength
was leaving her ... she was down on one knee ...
then suddenly, she could never remember how, she was
free, and running, running as she had never run before,
her breath sobbing in her throat—across the field of the
toadstools and sour grass, away from the shadow of
Forges Wood, in the orchard, to see the gable of Worge
rising against the pewter—grey of the clouds that hid
the moon.</p>

<p>At the orchard edge she had the sense to stop and tidy
herself. There was no longer any fear of pursuit—if
indeed she had ever been pursued. She had dropped
her shawl in the field, her blouse was torn open at the
neck, her hair was down on her shoulders, and her face
all blotched with excitement and tears. Also, a new
experience, she was trembling from head to foot, and her
shaking hands could scarcely fasten her blouse and twist
up her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“You beast!” she sobbed, as she fumbled; “you beast!
You dirty gipsy!”</p>

<p>Then an unaccountable longing seized her for her
mother—she longed to throw her arms round her
mother’s neck and cry upon her shoulder. With a little
plaintive moan she started off again for the house, but
by the time she reached the doorstep the craving had
passed.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>For half an hour after Ivy left him, Jerry lay on his
face in Forges Wood, motionless save every now and
then for a quiver of his shoulders. Over him the boughs
of the ash-trees cracked and sighed, under him the
trodden leaves rustled creepingly. He felt them cold
and moist against his cheek, with the clammy mould of
nettles, weeds that were trampled and dead. His heart
in him was dead—cold, heavy and sodden as a piece of
rain-soaked earth. The fire in him was out—it had
driven him mad and died. By his short madness,
scarcely five minutes long, he had lost Ivy for ever. She
was gone as the summer was gone from the woods, but,
unlike the summer, she would never come back. A sour,
eternal autumn lay before him, sour as the grass and
toadstools of Forges Field, eternal as the blind, creeping
force from which toadstools are spawned into fields and
poor men’s hearts.</p>

<p>At last he rose to his feet, and stumbled off, plunging
into the thickets of Forges Wood, through the ash-plats
and the oak-scrub. Scarcely realising what he was doing,
he forced his way out of the wood, through its hedge of
brambled wattles, into the lane. The pewterish sky hung
low over the hedges, and in its dull glimmer he could see
the road under his feet. He soon clambered out of the
lane, pushing through the hedge into the fields of Padgham.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>

To eastward lay the thick, black woods of Furnacefield,
and the cry of an owl came out of them, plaintively.</p>

<p>Jerry wandered in the fields till dawn, his heart cold
and heavy as a clod, though now and then little crawls
of misery went into it, like a live thing creeping into the
earth. He had lost Ivy for ever ... his own madness—which
was gone—had taken her from him ... she was
gone, as the summer was gone from the woods....</p>

<p>He came nearly as far south as Hazard’s Green, but
mostly roamed in his own tracks, prowling the barns of
Burntkitchen. Then, when a thin, greenish light shone
like mould on the pewtered sky, a sudden childish craving
came to him, the same that had come to Ivy in the
orchard. As she had wanted her mother in her fright
and misery, so he wanted his father, and ran home.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>A light was burning at the Horselunges, but the cold
lamp of dawn shone on Jerry as he stood fumbling in
the doorway, then, finding the door unlocked, crept in.
A footstep creaked in his father’s room, and the next
minute the door was flung open and the minister stood
at the top of the stairs, blocked against the light, looming,
monstrous, like a huge black Satan.</p>

<p>“Where’ve you been?”</p>

<p>“In the woods.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s teeth were chattering as his father took him
by the arm and pulled him into the room. A fire was
burning on the hearth, with the old, old cat purring
squeakily before it, while the broken-winged thrush,
which Mr. Sumption had forgotten to cover up for the
night, hopped to and fro, twittering its best effort at a
song.</p>

<p>“Oh, may the Lord forgive you, you scamp,” groaned

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

the minister, as Jerry fell crumpled on the sofa. His
boots and uniform were caked with leaf-mould and clay,
his hair was full of leaves and mud and his face was
streaked with dirty wet.</p>

<p>“Are you hungry?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>There was a pot of something on the fire, but it was
just as well that Jerry was not hungry, for it had been
burnt to a cinder long ago.</p>

<p>“I’ve been sitting up for you all night,” said Mr.
Sumption. “When you didn’t come in, I went over to
Worge, and Ivy said you’d been out with her, but had
gone off by yourself, she didn’t know where. She’s a
kind girl, and told me not to worry.”</p>

<p>“Father—I’ve lost her for ever.”</p>

<p>It was the first time he had said the words aloud, and
their wretchedness swept over him, breaking his spirit,
so that he began to cry.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost her ... I was mad ... and she’s gone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption stood staring at the small, slight figure
on the sofa, lying with its dirty face turned away, its
back showing him the split tunic of a soldier of the King.
His bowels yearned towards the son of the woman from
Ihornden, and his rage switched violently from Jerry
to the cause of his grief.</p>

<p>“Drat the girl! Drat the slut! What is she after,
despising her betters? She’s led you on—she’s played
with you. Don’t trouble about her, Jerry, my boy. She
isn’t worth it.”</p>

<p>“I love her,” gasped Jerry—“and I’ve lost her. It’s
my own fault. I went mad. I frightened her....
Father, I’m a beast—I reckon Satan’s got me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption patted his shoulder.</p>

<p>“I reckon Satan’s got me,” moaned the boy—“or why

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>

did I go wild like that?”</p>

<p>“Satan can’t hurt the elect.”</p>

<p>“What’s that to me? I reckon I’m none of your elect.
I’m just a poor boy who’s done for himself.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption dropped on his knees beside him, and
began to pray.</p>

<p>“O Lord, Thou hast given me a sore trial in this son
of mine, and now terrible doubts are in my soul as to
whether he is one of the elect for whom Jesus died. O
Lord, he’s my flesh and bone, and the flesh and bone of
my dear wife who’s dead, and yet it looks as if Satan
had got him. O Lord, save my son from the lion and
my darling from the power of the dog, from the dreadful
day that shall burn like an oven, and the furnace of pitch
and tow....”</p>

<p>“Father, have done, do—you give me the creeps.”</p>

<p>“I’m praying for your soul, ungrateful child.”</p>

<p>“Let my soul be—I’m tired to death.”</p>

<p>Indeed a grey shade of utter weariness had crept into
his skin, so that his face looked ghastly in the morning
twilight fighting round the lamp. Mr. Sumption, who
had stood up, knelt down again, and took off Jerry’s
boots.</p>

<p>“Have a sleep then, my laddie—there on the sofy.
It’s scarce worth going to bed. Besides, you’d have to
clean yourself first.”</p>

<p>“You won’t leave me, father—you’ll stay along of
me?”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay along of you and pray quiet.”</p>

<p>Jerry gave a grunt, and drew up his knees to his chin,
like some animal rolling itself for sleep. Mr. Sumption
knelt beside him and continued his prayer:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“O Lord, Thou hast a son, and doesn’t Thou know
what I feel about this wretched boy of mine? Lord,
give me a token that he is not predestined to everlasting
death; save him from the snares of hell, in which he
seems tangled like a bird in the snare of the fowler....”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, do pray cheerful,” groaned Jerry.</p>

<p>But praying cheerful was quite beyond the poor
father’s powers, never remarkable in this direction at
the best of times. All he could do was to sing, “Let
Christian faith and hope dispel the fears of guilt and
woe,” till Jerry had fallen asleep.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>Three hours later he woke, to find Mrs. Hubble’s big
wooden wash-tub in front of the fire.</p>

<p>“Up you get,” said the Reverend Mr. Sumption, “and
into that bath, and I’ll take your clothes down to be
cleaned and mended before you go to the station.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to the station.”</p>

<p>“You’re going there two hours from now, or you
won’t be in Waterheel to-night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be in Waterheel ever again.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Sumption was not having any nonsense. A
large hairy paw like a gorilla’s shot out and swung Jerry
by the collar on to the floor. “Now strip, you ungodly
good-for-nothing, and I’ll send you out looking like a
clergyman’s son.”</p>

<p>Jerry, groaning and moaning to himself, got into the
bath, while Mr. Sumption took his dirty bundle of
clothes down to Mrs. Hubble’s kitchen, where a long and
noisy argument followed on her abilities to make bricks
without straw, as she called his request to make his son
look decent. He returned to the study to find Jerry less
stiff in the joints, but growing every minute more defiant
and miserable as the steaming water cleared the fogs of
sleep from his brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not going back to camp. I’d die if I was to go
there—with Ivy lost. It was bad enough when I had
her to think of and all——But now ... I’d justabout
break my heart.”</p>

<p>“Maybe after a time you can write to her again——”</p>

<p>“I can’t, I tell you. You don’t understand. I’ve
lost her for ever. I frightened her—I made her scream.”</p>

<p>“You’re a beast,” said his father.</p>

<p>“Reckon I am, and reckon you’re treating me like one.”</p>

<p>“If you stay behind, they’ll nab you for an absentee.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care if they do. I’d sooner be locked up,
than a soldier any more.”</p>

<p>“For shame, boy!”</p>

<p>“Well, how’d you like to be a soldier?—sworn at all
day by bloody sergeants, and always fatigue and C.B.
I’m fed up, I tell you, and I’m not going back.”</p>

<p>“You’ll go back, if I have to pull you all the way by
the ears.”</p>

<p>“You’re the cruellest father I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption lost his temper, and cuffed Jerry’s head
as he sat in the tub. Luckily the boy’s defiance had been
only the false flare of damp spirits, and instead of receiving
the blow with an explosion of anger, he was merely
cowed by it. Whereat Mr. Sumption’s heart melted,
and he saw the piteousness of this poor little soldier,
whose heart was black with some evil beyond his
help.</p>

<p>The rest of the time passed amicably, till Mrs. Hubble,
with many contemptuous sniffs, brought up Jerry’s uniform
brushed and mended, and after he was dressed he
did not look so bad, especially as the bath had had the
humiliating result of making his skin look several shades
lighter.</p>

<p>Breakfast followed, and afterwards he and his father
set out for Senlac Station, taking the longer North Road
by Woods Corner and Darwell Hole, instead of that
shorter, more dangerous, way past the gate of Worge.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

It was a morning of clear, golden distances, with pillars
and towers and arches of cloud moving solemnly before
the wind across a borage-blue sky. Drops of dew fell
from the trees on the backs of the two men, and the air
was full of the smell of earth and wet leaves, and that
faint mocking smell of spring which sometimes comes
in autumn.</p>

<p>As they tramped along the North Road, away from
the Obelisk by Lobden’s House, which allows a Dallington
man to see his village for miles after he has left it,
Mr. Sumption spoke very patiently and kindly to his son.</p>

<p>“Keep good and straight,” he said, “for you’re a good
woman’s son, and some day you’ll find a woman whom
you’ll love as I loved your mother. May she be to you
all that your mother was to me, and may you keep her
longer. But don’t go running after strange women, or
think to forget love in wantonness. One day, if you trust
the Lord, you’ll meet a girl that has been worth keeping
good for, that you’ll find lovelier than Ivy Beatup, and
ull think herself honoured to marry a clergyman’s son.”</p>

<p>“Clergyman’s son ...” murmured Jerry, in tones
that made Mr. Sumption swoop round on him with uplifted
hand, to see a look on his face that made him
thrust it back into his pocket.</p>

<p>His eyes were still full of his mysterious trouble, but
he did not speak of it so much. He just plodded on
beside his father like a calf to slaughter, and at last they
came to Senlac Town, with the houses like barley-stacks
in the sunshine. They were early, and had half an hour
to wait at the station. A train had just come in, and as
they crossed the bridge they suddenly met Tom Beatup.</p>

<p>“Tom!” cried the minister, cracking his joints with
delight. “Who’d have thought to meet you! I’d no
idea you were coming home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor had I till yesterday—seven days’ leave before
I go to France. I sent off a telegram, but I reckon it
was too late for them to get it last night. Hullo, Jerry!
Enjoyed yourself?”</p>

<p>“Unaccountable,” said Jerry with a leer.</p>

<p>“Wait for me, Tom,” said Mr. Sumption, “and we’ll
walk home together. I shan’t be more than twenty
minutes or so.”</p>

<p>“I’m justabout sorry, but I must git off this wunst.
Reckon I’ll see you again soon.”</p>

<p>“Come round to the Horselunges one evening.”</p>

<p>“I will, surelye”—and Tom was off, whistling
“Sussex by the Sea.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Mr. Sumption that he looked a bigger,
older man than the Tom Beatup of five months ago.
He seemed to have grown and filled out, he had lost his
yokel shuffle, and his uniform was smart and neat. The
minister glanced down at Jerry, who stood beside him,
small, untidy, cowed and furtive. Jerry undoubtedly
did not look his best in uniform—it seemed to exaggerate
the worst of those gipsy characteristics which he had
inherited from the Rossarmescroes or Hearns. Now,
in civvies he used not to look so bad—he was a well-made,
graceful little chap....</p>

<p>“Jerry,” said Mr. Sumption, “why can’t you look like
Tom Beatup?”</p>

<p>“I reckon it’s because I’m Jerry Sumption—the clergyman’s
son.”</p>

<p>And again there was that look on his face which prevented
retaliation.</p>


<h3>13</h3>

<p>In the old days it used to take Tom a good couple of
hours to walk from Senlac to Sunday Street—but then,
he had generally been behind a drove of lazy tups or
heifers, or silly scattering sheep. To-day he swung
smartly along, scarcely feeling the weight of his kit-bag,
whistling as he walked. It was good to feel the soft thick

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>

fanning of the Sussex air, so different from the keen
Derbyshire wind, with its smell of bilberries and slaty
earth; to see the old places along the North Trade—Whitelands,
Park Gate, Burntkitchen, and then, when he
came to the throws, that wide sudden view of the country
bounded by the Four Roads, swamped in hazy sunshine,
with the trickle of lanes and the twist of the rough,
blotched hedges, and the pale patches of the stubble, and
the low clouds sailing over it from Cross-in-Hand. He
walked through Brownbread Street, empty save for the
waggon-team that drowsed outside the George, silent save
for the hum of children’s voices in the school. Then he
came to Pont’s Green, where the lane to Sunday Street
meets the East Road. The hops were being picked in the
low sheltered fields by Slivericks Wood, and the smoke
of the drying furnace streamed out of the cowl of the
oasthouse at the throws, while all the air seemed heavy
with the sweet, sleepy scent of stripping bines.</p>

<p>He had meant, traitorously, to call at the shop before
he went home; but just as he came to the willow-pond,
a small dusty figure ran out of the hedge, and seized him
round the waist.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Zacky! Wot are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t bin to school—I couldn’t go when I heard
you wur coming. Mother got your telegram this mornun,
and she wur sure it wur to say as you wur killed.”</p>

<p>“Was she pleased when she found it wasn’t?”</p>

<p>“Unaccountable. But she’d nigh cried her eyes out
first, and told Ivy and Nell as something tarr’ble had
happened to you, afore they found as she’d never opened
the telegram.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write a letter next time,” said Tom; “but I

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

never knew for sure till yesterday that I’d be gitting
leave so soon.”</p>

<p>He did not scold Zacky for having stayed away from
school. It was a relief not to have to exercise quasi-paternal
authority any more, but just to take the truant’s
hand and walk with him to Worge Gate—where Mus’
Beatup was standing with his gun, having seen Tom in
the distance from Podder’s Field, where the conies are,
while Mrs. Beatup was running down the drive from the
house, her apron blowing before her like a sail.</p>

<p>“Here you are, my boy,” said Mus’ Beatup sententiously,
clapping him on the shoulder. “Come to see
how we’re gitting on now you’ve left us. The oald farm’s
standing yit—the oald farm’s standing yit.”</p>

<p>“And looks valiant,” said Tom, grinning, and kissing
his mother.</p>

<p>“Not so valiant as it ud look if there wurn’t no war
on.”</p>

<p>“Maybe—that cud be said of most of us.”</p>

<p>“Not of you, Tom,” said Mrs. Beatup. “I never saw
you look praaperer than to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m in splendid heart—eat till I’m fit to bust.”</p>

<p>“You wear your cap like Bill Putland,” said Zacky.
“It maakes you look different-like.”</p>

<p>Tom’s cap indeed had a rakish tilt over one ear,
though he did not profess to imitate Bill Putland’s
jauntiness.</p>

<p>“Maybe old Bill ull git a bit of leave in a week or two.
I see Jerry Sumption’s gone back to-day. I met him and
minister at the station.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup gave a snort.</p>

<p>“And unaccountable glad I am to see the last of Gipsy
Jerry; he’s justabout plagued Ivy to death all the time
he’s bin here. She says she’s shut of him, and I hope to
goodness she means it.”</p>

<p>“Jerry shud never have gone fur a soldier,” said Tom.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>

“He’s got no praaper ideas of things, and is fur ever
gitting in trouble. Come, mother, let’s be walking up to
the house and put my bag in the bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Wot’s in your bag?” asked Zacky.</p>

<p>“Soap, razor, slacks, and one or two liddle bits of
things,” said Tom, grinning down at him in proud consciousness
of two pounds of Derby rock—to such magnificence
had his sweetmeat buying risen from his old penn-’orths
of bull’s-eyes.</p>

<p>They walked up to the house, and greetings came with
Ivy hanging out the clothes, and Harry toiling over the
corn accounts in shame-faced arrears. Then his bag was
unpacked, and presents given to everybody—sweetstuff
to Zacky and Harry, a good knife to his father, and to
his mother a wonderful handkerchief case with the arms
of the Royal Sussex worked in lurid silks; there was a
needlebook of the same sort for Nell, when she should
come home from school; and for Ivy there was a mother-o’-pearl
brooch, and, which she liked even better, messages
from a dozen Sussex chaps at Waterheel.</p>

<p>Then as the family went back to its business, Tom,
who for the first time in his life had none, slipped out of
the house, and jogged quietly down the drive towards
the village. There would be just time before dinner to
call at the shop.</p>

<p>The blind was down, for the sunshine was streaming
in at the little leaded window, threatening the perils of
dissolution to the sugar mice (made before the sugar
scarcity, indeed, it must be confessed, before the War)
and of fermentation to the tinned crab. Tom’s hand may
have shaken a little as he pulled down the latch, but
except for that his manner was stout, very different from
his sheepish entrances of months ago.</p>

<p>Buzz ... ting ... Thyrza looked up from the packing-case
she was breaking open behind the counter. The
next moment she gave a little cry. She had just been

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>

thinking of Tom at Waterheel, wondering if it was his
dinner-time yet, and what Cookie had put in the stew;
and then she had lifted her eyes to see his broad, sunburnt
face smiling at her from the door, with his hair
curling under his khaki cap, and his sturdy figure looking
at once stronger and slimmer in its uniform.</p>

<p>“Tom!” she gasped, and held out her hand across
the counter—hoping....</p>

<p>But he had gone beyond the timid daring of those
days. Before she knew what was happening, he had
marched boldly round behind the counter and taken her
in his arms.</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>Tom’s family gave a poor reception to his news that
this was “last leave” before going to France.</p>

<p>“I knew as that there telegram meant something
tar’ble,” wailed Mrs. Beatup. “It wurn’t fur naun I
cried, Nell, though you did despise me.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t despise you,” said Nell; “you’re very unjust,
mother.”</p>

<p>“Unjust, am I?—wud my boy going out to be
slaughtered like a pig.”</p>

<p>“I aun’t going to be slaughtered, mother—not if I
know it. It’s I who’ll do the slaughtering.”</p>

<p>“You who’d go swummy at wringing a cockerel’s neck....
Reckon a German ull taake some killing—want
more’n a twist and a pull.”</p>

<p>“He’ll want no more’n I’ve got to give him. Now,
doan’t you taake on so, mother—there’s naun to vrother
about. Maybe I woan’t be off so soon after all—it’s only
an idea that’s going round. And if I do go, I aun’t
afeard. I’ve a feeling as no harm ull come to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I’ve a feeling as it will. Howsumdever ...
I mun think as I’ve got four children left ... and a
hoame ... and a husband”—remembering her blessings
one by one.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup was inclined to be contemptuous.</p>

<p>“Wot fur are they sending you out now? You’ve
bin training scarce five month.”</p>

<p>“Many of the boys git less.”</p>

<p>“Maybe they do, wud Governmunt being wot it is.
As if anyone wud know cudn’t see as it taakes ten year
to maake a looker.”</p>

<p>“Reckon things have to go quicker in the Army than
on a farm. If we all took ten years to git ready, the
Bosches ud have us middling soon.”</p>

<p>“They’d taake ten years, too, and it ud all go much
better.”</p>

<p>“At that raate we’d never have done, surelye.”</p>

<p>“And wot maakes you think as we’ll ever have done,
as things are?... Go forrard five mile in a year, and
it’ll be two hundred years afore we git to the Kayser’s
royal palace. You see ’em all fighting around a farm
as it wur the Tower of Lunnon—their objective, they call
it. If Worge wur an objective it ud taake the Germans
fifteen month to git into it, and we’d taake another fifteen
month to git ’em out; and then they’d git in agaun, and
it ud go on lik that till the plaace wur in shards. I tell
you this aun’t a hurrying sort of war, and ull be won by
them wot lives longest.”</p>

<p>Tom was impressed. “Seemingly you know more
about it than I do.”</p>

<p>“I read the paapers, and reckon I do a bit of thinking
as well.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you do. Howsumdever, it’s my plaace to
fight and not to think—I leave that to men lik you.”</p>

<p>In spite of his respect for Mus’ Beatup as a military
tactician, he was a bit disgusted with him as a farmer.
A searching of the farm accounts and an examination

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>

of the shame-faced Harry revealed a state of affairs even
more depressing than he had looked for. The harvest
had been mismanaged, the oats having been allowed to
stand too long, and a quantity of seed had been lost.
The blight had got into the hops owing to insufficient
spraying, and two sheep had died of bronchitis. Tom
was at first inclined to be angry. Harry acknowledged
having played truant on one or two important occasions,
though he insisted, whiningly, that he had worked “lik
ten black slaves” for most of the summer. If he had
always been on the spot, the aberrations of Mus’ Beatup
and the laziness and pigheadedness of Elphick and Juglery
might have been counteracted to a certain degree.
Tom would have liked to have beaten Harry, just to teach
him the disadvantages of ratting in harvest-time, but he
was now oddly loath to exercise the old compulsory
tyrannies. He saw, too, the pathos of Harry’s youth,
forced to play watch-dog to middle-aged vice and ancient
inefficiency.</p>

<p>So, instead of being angry, he was just patient. He
went out a good deal during his leave, and the family
whispered, “Thyrza Honey”; but in the afternoons and
soft evenings, when all the fields were rusty in the harvest
moon, he would walk with Harry over the farm, and
point out to him the work that would have soon to be
done in the way of sowings and diggings, with never a
word of reproach for the pitiable deeds of the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“It aun’t too late to try fur a catch crop or two—harrow
some clover on the Volunteer stubble, and if you
sow early and late red, and late white, you’ll git cuttings
right on into June. I wudn’t have potato oats agaun fur
the Street field—their rootses git too thick fur clays,
and they shed seed unaccountable if you leave them standing
a day over their due. Try Sandy oat this fall—and
Flemish oat is good in clays, I’ve heard tell. And the
two-acre shud go into potash next year—wurzels or
swedes, or maybe potatoes.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never kip all this in my head, Tom.”</p>

<p>“You’ll justabout have to, sonny. I tell you this
farm’s your job, saum as mine’s soldiering. I’m going
to fight fur Worge, and you’ve got to back me up and
see as Worge is kept going fur me to fight fur.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, surelye—but you must write, Tom,
and maake me mind it all. Write and say, ‘This week
you must drill the two-acre’—or ‘To-morrow’s the day
to start thinning,’ or ‘Maake a strong furrer this frost,’
so’s I shan’t disremember the lot.”</p>

<p>“I’ll send you a postcard at whiles, to kip you up to it;
but I shan’t be here to see how things are going, so you’ll
have to trust to your own gumption. And doan’t go
agaunst faather when he’s sober, fur he’s a clever chap
and knows wot he’s doing; but when he’s tight doan’t
let him meddle, for he’s unaccountable contrary and ud
pot a harvest just to spite the Government. As fur
Juglery and Elphick, they’ve got no more sense nor roots,
so doan’t you ever be asking wot to do of them.”</p>

<p>Harry was impressed by all this counsel. But perhaps
its real weight lay in Tom’s new glamour, his khaki uniform,
his occasional jauntiness, his military slang and
tales of camp life. He had always been fond of his
brother and liked him for a good fellow; but now he
went a step further, and admired him. There was something
about this quiet, neat, efficient young soldier,
which had been lacking in good-natured old Tom, with
his dirty skin and sloppy corduroys. Without quite
understanding what it was, or how it had come there,
Harry was both sensible and envious of it. He felt that
he would like to be a soldier too, wear khaki, carry
mysterious tools, and have before him a dim, glorious
adventure called France. But since these things were

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>

not to be, a kind of rudimentary hero-worship led him
to make plans for “carrying on” at home. He would
not disappoint this soldier brother, who had exalted his
work on the farm by speaking of it as part of the adventure
on which he was so much more glamorously
engaged. He had never seen it in that light before—for
that matter, neither had Tom. But now he would try
to do his share—back Tom up, as he had said. Harry’s
nature was more ardent than his brother’s, more
romantic in its clay-thickened way, and on this ardour
and romance Tom had unconsciously built. There was
now a chance of his memory calling louder than Senlac
Fair or the wood by Cade Street.</p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>Tom did not tell his family about Thyrza Honey till
the morning he left Sunday Street. He knew they were
curious, but he felt that he would rather face their
curiosity than their comments. They were sure to be
pleased at the news from a material standpoint, but
against that he had to balance the fact that the women—except,
perhaps, Ivy—did not like Thyrza, and that his
mother still looked upon him as a little boy, too young to
think of marrying. He had looked upon himself in that
light six months ago—it was queer how much older he
felt now. Surely it did not make you all that much older
to have the sergeant howling at you, or to sleep with fifty
men in a hut, or to eat stew out of a dixey.... Yet, the
fact remained, that in April he had felt a boy and in September
he felt a man; and, more—he was a man; for
Thyrza had accepted him as her lover, and had promised
to let him fulfil his manhood as her husband.</p>

<p>At present he was content with the first stage. Each
day held a new wonder. Yet he did nothing more

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>

wonderful than sit with her in the little room behind the
shop—the sanctuary into which he had so often peeped
in the old days, wondering what Thyrza thought and did
there in the humming firelight, with her kettle and her
cat and her account-books in which all the little traffic
of the shop was entered with sucked pencil and puckered
brows.</p>

<p>He would sit by her and hold her hand, so large and
soft and firm, turning it over and over in his own, kissing
it back and palm. Her manner was a little motherly, for
she was touched by the fact that she was the first woman
he had ever held or kissed, while her own experience was
deep and bitter. She was older than he was too, and, as
she thought, sharper at the uptake, though certainly he
had improved in this of late. She would hold him in her
arms, with his head against her breast, held between her
heart and her elbow, as she had for a few short minutes
held the little baby who died.... She never asked herself
why she loved him so much better than the big,
strong, hairy Bourner, or than Hearsfield, whose hands
were white as a gentleman’s; all she knew was that she
loved him, and that she pitied him for the fond no-reason
that he loved her and through her was learning his first
lessons in woman and love.</p>

<p>Then before he went home she would make him tea,
or supper perhaps, and herself gain new sweet experience
in ministering to the material wants of the man whose
spirit she held. No meal prepared for Honey had been
like this, and they would sit over it cosily together, all
the more conscious of their union when the little buzzing
bell of the shop divided them, and Tom, new privileged,
would sit in the back room listening to Thyrza serving
Putlands or Sindens or Bourners or Hubbles, and getting
rid of them as quickly as she could—which, it must be
confessed, was not very quick, for she was far too soft

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>

and kind to turn anyone out who seemed to want to stay.
Then the bell which had divided them would bring them
together again as it rang behind the departing shopper,
and Thyrza would come back to the lover waiting for her
in the red twilight beside the singing fire.</p>

<p>They did not go out together till the last evening.
Then he came to tea and stayed to supper, and in the
interval they went into the lane just as the dusk came
stealing up the sky. Thyrza had objected at first.</p>

<p>“We closed early yesterday, and folk ull be vexed if
they find us shut this evenun too.”</p>

<p>“Folk be hemmed! This is my last evenun, and I’m
going to taake you where we can’t hear that tedious
liddle bell of yourn.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t miscall my bell, fur it rings when you come
to see me. In the old days when it rang, I used to say
to myself, ’Is that Tom?’ and look through the winder,
hoping....”</p>

<p>“Thyrza, did you love me then?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I did. But I doan’t know as I ever thought
much about it, fur I maade sure as at the raate you wur
going it ud be a dunnamany years afore you started
courting praaperly.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I didn’t wait, surelye. Oh, liddle creature,
you can’t know wot this week’s bin to me. I’ll go out to
France feeling ... feeling ... I can’t tell you wot I
feel, but it’s as if I wur leaving part of myself behind,
and that the part I left behind wur helping and backing
up the part out there ... it sounds unaccountable silly
when I say it, but it’s wot I’ve got in my heart.”</p>

<p>They were in the big pasture meadow near Little
Worge, sitting by the willow-pond which lay cupped
against the lane. It was the first and the last landmark
in Sunday Street—the thick scummed water with the
grey trees dipping their leaves in its stillness. To-day a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

soft wind rustled in them, blowing from the west, and
scarcely louder than the wind throbbed the distant guns,
the beating of that racked far-off heart whose terrible
secrets Tom was soon to know. Thyrza shuffled against
his side as they sat on the grass.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom—hear the guns? It’s tar’ble to think of
you out there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back, surelye.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel as if you will?”</p>

<p>“Surelye—since I’ve left half myself behind.”</p>

<p>Her arms stole round him, and the beating of that far-away
heart was drowned in the beating of his under her
cheek.</p>

<p>A pale cowslip light was in the sky, creeping over the
fields, putting yellower tints into Thyrza’s butter skin
and a web of gold over her ashen hair. Gradually it
seemed to flower in the dusk till all the field was lit up
... the mounds and molehills with hollows scooped
darkly against the light, the pond like thick yellow glass,
the willows like drooping flame. The picture became
graven on Tom’s heart—the grey sky blooming with light
and shedding it down on the field of the mounds and
molehills, the pond, the willows, and the woman drowsing
in his arms—so that when later in France he thought
of England, he thought of it only as that willow-pond
at the opening of Sunday Street, and Thyrza Honey
lying heavy and warm and sweet against his breast.</p>

<p>“Hold me close, Tom, dearie—hold me close, so’s I
doan’t hear the war. Aun’t it queer how our hearts beat
louder than the guns!...”</p>

<h2>PART III: THYRZA</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT
autumn and winter there was a lot of talk
in the papers about food. Wedged into news of
the Ancre and Beaumont Hamel, the crumpling-up
of Roumania under von Mackensen, and President
Wilson’s Peace Note, came paragraphs and letters and
articles on food and the ways of economising and producing
it. The latter most troubled Harry, as he thought
of the modest spring-sowings of Worge. If it was indeed
true that the German U-boats were threatening the country’s
wheat supply, might it not be as well to reclaim the
old tillage of the Sunk Field or even break up grass-land
in the high meadows by Bucksteep?</p>

<p>Harry did not often read the papers, getting all his
news from the <cite>Daily Express</cite> poster which Mrs. Honey
displayed outside the shop when the papers arrived at
noon; but when paper-restrictions brought posters to an
end, he went skimming through Mus’ Beatup’s <cite>Sussex
News</cite>, and one day skimming was changed to plodding
by a very solid article on wheat-production and the present
needs.</p>

<p>In many ways it was a revelation to Harry. Though
he had been a farm-boy all his life it had never struck
him till then that grain-growing was of any importance
to the nation, or imagined that the Worge harvests mattered
outside Worge. The fields, the stock had been to
him all so many means of livelihood, and the only motive
of himself and his fellow-workers the negative one of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>

keeping Worge from the auctioneer’s. If he ever realised
his part in the great adventure, it was only when he saw
his duty to keep the place together for Tom to fight for.
This was his newest and highest motive, and when he
refused the call of distant woods, broke with the Brownbread
rat-and-sparrow club, and paid no more than a
business visit to Senlac Fair, it was so that Tom’s sacrifice
should not be in vain. But here was a chap making out
that a farmer was very nearly as important as a soldier,
and that it was on the wheat-fields of England as well as
on the battlefields of France that the war would be
won....</p>

<p>After this, Harry always read the food-supply news,
and pondered it. Was it indeed true that the war which
was being waged with such gallantry and fortitude
abroad might be lost at home? For the first time he had
a personal interest in the struggle, apart from the interest
he felt through Tom. Hitherto the war had meant
nothing to him, because he had thought he meant nothing
to the war—he was too young to be a soldier, probably
always would be, since everyone said that peace would
come next year. All he had had of warfare was the
distant throb and grumble of guns a hundred miles away—not
even a prowling Taube or lost Zeppelin had visited
the country within the Four Roads. First the lighting
order, then the liquor control, then the Conscription Act—only
thus and indirectly had the war touched him,
requiring of him merely a passive part. But now he saw
that he also might take his active share, and the realisation
set fire to his clay.</p>

<p>The winter was a bad one—bitterly cold, with thick
green ice on the ponds, and a skimming of hard snow
on the fields, where the soil was like iron. The marshes
of Horse Eye were sheeted with a frozen overflow, and
the wind that rasped and whiffled from the east, stung

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>

the skin like wire, and piercing the cracks of barns,
made the stalled cattle shiver and stamp. There was
little work on the farm, though Harry had done his best
to fulfil Tom’s injunctions, and had carted his manure
and turned a strong furrow to the frost. The lambing
had been got through somehow—but two ewes and three
or four lambs had died, as they would never have done
if Tom had been there. At every turn Harry was faced
by his own inexperience, and learned only at the price of
many disappointments and much humiliation.</p>

<p>But he was the type which failure only makes dogged,
and his unsuccessful winter helped his new sense of the
country’s need in making him plan daringly for the
spring. He resolved that his apprenticeship should not
last beyond the winter—it was his own fault that it had
lasted so long—and in March he would get to business,
and start his scheming for doubling the grain acreage of
the farm.</p>

<p>There were several acres of old tillage to be reclaimed,
and Harry was young and daring and amateurish enough
to contemplate also breaking up grass-land. He would
of course have to consult his father first. Mus’ Beatup
had spent a sorry winter, “kipping the coald out” at the
Rifle Volunteer. The slackness of farm work, the cold
and discomfort of the weather, the growing unpalatableness
of his meals, all combined for worse results than
usual, and by the time of the keen wintry spring there
was no denying that a good slice of both his physical and
mental vigour had been eaten away. However, he was
still the nominal head of the farm, and must be consulted—Tom
would have had it so. Unfortunately, Harry
chose the wrong day. Mus’ Beatup was sober, but suffering
from an internal chill as a result of having lain for
an hour in the frozen slush a couple of nights ago, before
Nimrod the watch-dog found him and brought Harry out

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>

with his frantic barks. To-day he sat by the fire, shuddering
and muttering to himself, drinking a cup of hot
cocoa and swearing at his wife because there was no
sugar in it.</p>

<p>“I can’t git none,” wailed Mrs. Beatup. “I tried at
the Shop, and Nell tried in Brownbread Street, and Ivy’s
tried in Dallington, and Harry asked when he wur over
at Senlac market....”</p>

<p>“And have you tried Rushlake Green and Punnetts
Town and Three Cups Corner and Heathfield and Hellinglye
and Hailsham? You try a bit further afore you
dare to give me this stuff.”</p>

<p>“But there aun’t none in the whole country—so I’ve
heard tell.”</p>

<p>“Maybe. Reckon Govunmunt’s got it all, saum as
they’ve got all the beer and the spirits. They’ve got
pounds and pounds of it, those there Cabinick Ministers,
and eat it for breakfast and dinner and tea. I tell you
I’m dog-sick of this war, and I’m hemmed if I move
another step to help a Govunmunt as taakes fust our
beer and then our boys, and then our sugar”—and Mus’
Beatup spat dramatically into the fire, as if it were
Whitehall.</p>

<p>The moment was not propitious, but Harry had to
consider the weather, which showed possibilities that
must be made use of at once. Mus’ Beatup listened
wearily to his suggestions.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s more wheat as they want, is it? They’re
going to take that next.... Reclaim the oald tillage?
Wot did we let it go fallow fur, if it wurn’t cos it dudn’t
pay the labour?... Break up the grass-land? You’ll
be asking to plough the kitchen floor next.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we doan’t do summat, I reckon we’ll be maade to.”</p>

<p>“Reckon we will—saum as we wur maade to give up
Tom. And they say this country’s fighting Prussian
tyranny.”</p>

<p>“Well, faather, if we doan’t grow more corn we’ll
lose the war. I wur reading in the paapers as all our
corn and wheat used to come from furrin parts, but now,
wud ships wanted to carry soldiers and them hemmed
U-boats spannelling around....”</p>

<p>“You talk lik the <cite>Sussex News</cite>. Wot d’you want to
go vrothering about them things fur? You do your work
and doan’t go roving.”</p>

<p>“Faather, I aun’t bin roving all this winter.”</p>

<p>“No, you aun’t—that’s a good lad, fur sartain
sure.”</p>

<p>“And if you let me do this job, I promise I’ll stick to
it and pull it through.”</p>

<p>“You might as well chuck your money into the pond
as spend it on grain-growing nowadays.”</p>

<p>“Not wud all these new arrangements the Govunmunt’s
maade ... guaranteed prices and all. Oh,
faather, let me try as I said. I want to do my bit saum
as Tom.”</p>

<p>“Seemingly your bit’s to land Worge at the auctioneer’s.
Howsumdever, do wot you lik—I’m ill and
helpless and oald. I can’t stop you. Now adone do
wud all this vrotherification of a poor sick man, and
ask mother to let me have a spoonful of syrup in this
nasty muck.”</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>So on Harry, sixteen years old, with little or no
experience, and a bad character to live down, fell the
task of bringing Worge into line with a national endeavour.
It was strange how his earthy imagination had
taken fire at the new idea, and a curious justification of
the Press. A sense of patriotism had wakened in him,
as it had not wakened in Tom after nearly a twelve-month’s
service. Tom was no longer indifferent or unwilling,
but his enthusiasm scarcely went beyond the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>

regiment—the feeling of “Sussex chaps”—the idea of fighting
for Worge, or, at the most abstract, “having a whack
at Kayser Bill.”</p>

<p>He had been in France about three months now. He
had not been sent over as soon as he expected, but in
November there had been a big draft from the 18th
Sussex, including Tom and Jerry and Bill, also Mus’
Archie—Mus’ Dixon, who had been badly gassed on the
Somme, stayed behind in charge of “School,” and
rumour said that he would not be sent out again. So
far Tom seemed to have had a far duller time abroad
than in England; he had not so much as seen a German;
and his letters home were chiefly about mud. The
family jealously hinted that his letters to Thyrza Honey
were more entertaining. However, he kept his promise
to Harry, and sent him councillor postcards now and
again. The last had consisted of just one word—“spuds!”</p>

<p>That was the spring when potatoes were being sold at
sixpence a pound in Eastbourne and Hastings, and such
inducements were held out to growers, that instead of
the usual modest half-acre, Harry intended to make potatoes
part of his new scheme. The two-acre was in
potash this year, also the home field, and Harry decided
to break up the pasture-land next the orchard. Some
of the space would have to be used for roots—swedes
and wurzels—but there would be a spud-growing such
as Worge had never seen in its history.</p>

<p>Then there was the more ticklish problem of the
grain, and what kinds to sow. Harry took Tom’s advice
and decided on Sandy oats for the Street field and the
field next the Volunteer. In the home field he would
grow awned wheat—and red spring wheat on the reclaimed
tillage of the Sunk Field.</p>

<p>Then came the problem of which grass-lands to break

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

up. If only Tom had been there to advise him! He
dare not ask his father, in case he should withdraw his
first permission. Breaking up grass-land is heresy to an
orthodox farmer, and it was quite possible that Mus’
Beatup would change his mind when it came to the crisis.
For this reason Harry said no more about it, and planned
craftily to start work on one of his father’s “bad days,”
when he would not be likely to interfere. Left without
counsel, he decided to break up the rest of the Sunk Field,
also Forges Field, and an old pasture at the Bucksteep
end of the farm. These were wretched soils and would
have to be heavily manured; but none of the soils round
Worge was really good, and some decent grass must be
left for the cows and ewes. Manures were scarce and
dear, owing to the war, but Harry thought he could make
shift with the farmyard dung, supplemented by a little
night-soil, and a ton of waste from the gypsum mines
near Robertsbridge.</p>

<p>All this cost him more thinking than he had ever done
in his life. Once or twice he lay awake from bed-time
till dawn, adding up figures, working out ways and
means, and making plans for settling any opposition,
drunk or sober, from Mus’ Beatup. His responsibility
was enormous, but he was at bottom too simple-minded
to feel the full weight of it, and his enthusiasm flamed
as clear as ever. By crabbed and common means—even
the smudgy columns of a provincial newspaper—the
vision had come to a country boy’s heart, and found
there a divine, undeveloped quality of imagination, and
an undisciplined power of enterprise. These two, which
had hitherto united to keep him from his work, were now
forged together in the heat of the new idea. But for the
first he would never have heard the call, and the second
alone made it possible that he should obey it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Harry could not help laughing at the faces of Juglery
and Elphick when he told them he meant to plough the
Sunk Field.</p>

<p>“Brëak up grass, Mus’ Harry!”</p>

<p>“Surelye! They’re asking farmers all over the country
to grow more wheat.”</p>

<p>“Does Maaster know as you mean to plough the
Sunk?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he does. I cud never do it wudout he let
me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said old Juglery, “I’ve bin on farm-work man
and boy these dunnamany year, and I’ve only bruk up
grass two times, and no good come of it, nuther. Wunst
it wur fur oald Mus’ Backfield up at Odiam, him wot
caum to nighe a hundred year, and then took a fit last
fall and died of joy when he heard as wheat wur ninety
shillings a quarter. T’other wur pore young Mus’ Pix
of the Trulilows, and he bruk up a valiant pasture, and
the oats caum up crawling about like pease, and each had
a gurt squlgy root lik a pertater. I says to him, being
young and joking like in those days, ‘You’re unaccountable
lucky,’ says I, ‘to grow pease and pertaters on the
same stalk,’ but he took it to heart, and went and shot
himself in the oast. So you see as boath the yeomen I
bruk up grass fur died, one o’ joy and t’other o’ sorrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t die of nuther, and we’ll have the
plough out Thursday if the weather hoalds.”</p>

<p>The men were getting used to being ordered about by
Harry. Mus’ Beatup’s chill had gone off in a twisting
bout of rheumatism, which returned every now and then
with damp weather. He spent, therefore, a good deal of
time in the house, with sometimes a hobble as far as the
Rifle Volunteer, appearing only in the dry, frosty weather

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>

when little could be done with harrow or plough. However,
when neighbouring farmers began to remark on the
enterprise of Worge, he was careful to take the credit
to himself—indeed he almost fancied that it was his own
doing, for Harry, who could have done nothing without
his authority, was careful to consult him on every occasion,
and it was Mus’ Beatup who ordered the grain
and checked the accounts, with many groans and dismal
foretellings.</p>

<p>Those were good days for Harry, behind his plough.
Under the soft grey spring sky, rifted and stroked by
wandering primrose lights, through the damp air that
smelled of living mould, over the brown earth that rolled
and sprayed like a wave from the driving coulter, he
toiled sweating in the raw March cold. The smell of
earth, the smell of his own sweat, the smell of the sweat
of his horses hung thick over the plough, but every now
and then soft damp puffs of air would blow into the
miasma the fragrance of grass and primrose buds, of
sticky, red, uncurling leaves, and the new moss in the
woods. The share gleamed against the dun, and the
brown twigs of the copses drew their spindled tracery
against a sky which was the paler colour of earth—sometimes
a shower would fall, slanting along the hedges, the
thick drops tasting on Harry’s lips of the unfulfilled
spring.</p>

<p>His work made him very tired. After all, he was
barely seventeen, and though sturdy had only just begun
to use his strength. The work of the farm was much
increased by the new plan, yet it was impossible to bring
extra hands to it, except occasionally by the conscription
of Zacky. Harry milked and ploughed and scattered and
dug, rising in the foggy blue darkness of the morning,
and often sitting up late over calculations and accounts.
Elphick and Juglery gave a pottering, rheumatic service,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

Mus’ Beatup could only be irregularly relied upon. So
in time Harry learned what it was to doze off out of sheer
weariness over his supper, or fall across the bed asleep
before he had pulled his trousers off. But strangely
enough, he found the life no hardship. Before the first
thrill of enterprise had passed he was beginning to like
the work for its own sake. There was a new keen
pleasure in the wearing of his muscles, almost a physical
luxury in his fatigue, and the lying with spread limbs
before the fire of evenings. His life seemed good and
full—everything was worth while, eating or sleeping or
toiling or resting. For the earth sometimes makes of her
servants lovers.</p>

<p>He was far too busy during his working hours and
weary during his leisure to find much temptation in his
old errant pleasures. Willie Sinden appealed in vain to
a grimy, sweaty Harry asleep for an hour before the
fire at night—he was too unaccountable wearied to
vrother about ratting or Willie’s new ferret; and he
went to Senlac and Heathfield and Hailsham Fairs to
sell beasts, not to drink ginger-beer or pot into the German
Kaiser’s mouth in the shooting-gallery. Even the distant
woods had ceased to call, for Harry was now tasting their
adventure in his daily work. The chocolate furrows of
the Sunk Field were part of that same wonder which had
teased him in the fluttering hazels of Molash Spinney or
the wind in the gorse-thickets of Thunders Hill. The
far-off village green of Bird-in-Eye was not more full
of spells than the new-sown acres by Forges Wood. By
his toil, and because he toiled as a man, from the spark
of imagination within him, and not as a beast from the
grind of circumstances without, he had brought the distant
adventure home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>In February Tom’s letters became more rousing. The
18th Sussex took part in the big advance on the Ancre,
and though Tom himself did not do anything very
exciting, he was no longer in the humiliating position of
having never seen a German. His descriptions of battle
were rather fumbling—“Then we had some tea and a
chap got in from the Glosters who had his tunick torn
something terrible.”—“We come into a French village
full of apple-trees and the walls were down so as you
saw into the houses, and in one house there was a pot
of ferns on the table.” He also confessed, in reply to
a message from Zacky, that though he had seen several
Germans, “with faces like roots,” he had not, to his
knowledge, killed one.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup thought it necessary to improve on his
son’s letters at the pub.</p>

<p>“Tom’s having valiant times,” he would say to the
bar of the Rifle Volunteer or of the Crown at Woods
Corner. “He killed a German officer wud his bayunite
and took his machine-gun. Mus’ Archie Lamb is unaccountable
proud of him, and says he’s sure to be a
lieutenant of the Sussex before long. He’s a good lad
is my lad, and it’s a tedious shaum as he was tuk away
from his praaper personal wark and maade a soldier of.
There’s none of my folk bin soldiers up till now—it’s
yeomen we’re born and we doan’t taake wages....
When’s he think the war ull stop?—Well, it might be
any time, if the Govunmunt doan’t starve us all fust.”</p>

<p>Sometimes Thyrza Honey brought Tom’s letters up
to read to the family at Worge. She was rather shy of
her future relations-in-law, who made no special effort
to be agreeable to her. Mrs. Beatup persisted in looking
on her as a designing woman who had forcibly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>

captured the innocent Tom, Nell was too clever for her,
and the males were grumpy and sidling. Only Ivy
seemed to like her, but Ivy was on bad terms with her
family at present, as ever since young Kadwell on leave
had forsaken his sweetheart of the Foul Mile for her
robuster charms, and the deserted one had turned up in
rage and dishevelment to make a personal protest at
Worge, the Beatups had chosen to resent her “goings
on.” They also threw Jerry Sumption in her teeth and
vaguely accused her of “things.” Now no young man
ever came to Worge without her parents lamenting that
they had a light daughter, and rows were frequent and
undignified. So Ivy’s liking was no recommendation of
Thyrza, who in consequence was suspected of goings on
herself. However, she would not give up her visits, for
she knew Tom liked her to pay them, and often—rather
tactlessly—sent messages to his family through her.</p>

<p>Thyrza knew more about the British front and the
Battle of the Ancre than did the Beatups. Not that
Tom could be eloquent even to her, but her imagination,
warmed by love, was quicker to piece together the fragments
and fill in the gaps. Also he told her things that
he would not have told the others. It was she who
heard the details of the great occasion on which he first
actually and personally killed a German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was sentry, and you always feel as the place is full
of Boshes, and you think you see them and it isn’t
them. Then one night after moon-up I thought I saw
a Bosh over against the enemy wire, and I said to myself
as he wasn’t a Bosh really, though my hair was all
standing up on my head. Then he moved and I let
fly with my rifle as I’ve done umpty times at nothing,
and then he was still and I saw him hanging on the wire.
Reckon he was dead, but I went on putting round after
round into him I felt so queer—not scared only kind
of enjoying it like as if you were shooting at the Fair,
only I knew as I was killing something and it made me
happy. But afterwards I got very cold and sick.”</p>

<p>“He never tells us how he feels about things,” complained
Mrs. Beatup. “It’s never more’n ‘I had my
dinner’ to us.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he doan’t git much time for writing letters.
He knows as wot he tells me gits passed on to you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll never say naun agaunst you, Thyrza Honey,
but I must point out as he knew us afore he knew you.
He’s unaccountable young to be shut of his mother, and
it ud be praaperer if his messages wur to you through
us.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup’s voice was hoarse with dignity, and
Thyrza hung her head.</p>

<p>“I’m the last as ud ever want to taake him away
from his mother,” she murmured—and ten days later
Mrs. Beatup got a thick smudgy letter on which Tom
had spent hours of ink and sweat in obedience to Thyrza’s
command.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>About a fortnight later an impudent-looking little girl
with a big mouth came wobbling up Worge drive on a
bicycle, and from a wallet extracted a telegram which she
handed to Zacky, who sat on the doorstep peeling a stick.
Zacky ran with it to his mother, who refused to open it.</p>

<p>“I’ll have no truck with telegrams—they’re bad things.
Fetch your faather.”</p>

<p>Zacky ran off in great excitement, and soon Mus’
Beatup came lumbering in, very red after planting
potatoes.</p>

<p>“Wot’s all this, mother?—another of those hemmed
telegrams?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, and I reckon Tom’s killed this time.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be—we only got a letter last night.”</p>

<p>“Ivy says they taake four days to come over. He
may have bin killed this mornun—got a shell in his
stomach lik Viner’s poor young boy.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s to say he’s coming hoame,” said Zacky.</p>

<p>“Shurrup!” growled his father.</p>

<p>He tore the envelope, with a queer twitching of the
corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>“He aun’t killed,” he said shakily—“only wounded.”</p>

<p>A moan came from the mother’s parted lips, and she
closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s naun very tar’ble,” continued the father.
“They said ‘serious’ in Mus’ Viner’s telegram; here it’s
only—‘regret to inform you that Private Beatup has been
wounded in action.’”</p>

<p>“Will they let me go to him?”</p>

<p>“Aun’t likely—he’s over in France.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup did not cry, but all the colour went from
her face and her lips were strangely blue. Then suddenly
her head fell over the back of the chair.</p>

<p>“Zacky!” shouted Mus’ Beatup—“fetch the whisky
bottle that’s in the pocket of my oald coat behind the
door.”</p>

<p>He put his arm round his wife, and lifted her head to
his shoulder, while Zacky ran off with piercing howls.
These were fortunately louder than those of the poor
duck whose neck Ivy was wringing outside the stable.
She rushed in, all bloody from her victim, and in a few
moments had laid her mother on the floor, unfastened
her dingy remains of stays, and dabbled her forehead
with water, while Mus’ Beatup, relieved of his stewardship,
stumped about, groaning, and drank the whisky
himself. In the midst of it all the big-mouthed little
girl, forgotten in the drive, started beating on the door
and demanding “if there was an answer, please.”

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>

Zacky was sent to dismiss her and vented his grief on
the messenger of woe by putting out his tongue at her
till she was out of sight—a salute which she returned
with all the increased opportunities that nature had given
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup soon recovered.</p>

<p>“I caum over all swummy like ... this is the first
time I’ve swounded since Zacky wur born ... I reckon
this is sharper than childbirth.”</p>

<p>The tears came at last, and she sobbed against Ivy’s
bosom.</p>

<p>“Doan’t go vrothering, mother. I tell you it’s naun
tar’ble. They said ‘seriously’ when poor Sid Viner wur
wounded to death, and Ted Podgam in Gallipoli. Maybe
they’ll send him hoame soon.”</p>

<p>“I want to go to him.... He’s got a hole in him....
Why do they kip his mother from him when he’s
sick? When he had measles he never let go my hand one
whole day, and he said, ‘Stay wud me, mother—I feel
tedious bad.’ Maybe he’s saying it now.”</p>

<p>“And maybe he aun’t. Maybe he’s setting up in bed
eating chicken and drinking wine, wud no more’n a piece
off his big toe.”</p>

<p>She took out a dirty handkerchief and wiped her
mother’s eyes. Then she said:</p>

<p>“I maun go and tell Thyrza Honey.”</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>But the fates had decided to honour Tom’s mother
above his sweetheart in that it was she alone who bore
the full grief of his wounding. On her way to the shop,
Ivy met Thyrza engaged in something as near a run as
her plump person was capable of, and waving in her
hand a letter. It was a pencil-scrawl written in hospital

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>

at Boulogne, telling Thyrza not to vrother, because he
was doing valiant. He had got a Blighty one and hoped
to be sent home soon. It was nothing serious, only a
bit of shrap in his foot. “Didn’t I tell mother as it was
no more’n a piece off his big toe?” cried Ivy triumphantly.</p>

<p>The letter had been Thyrza’s first news of Tom’s
wound, and all the anxiety and yearning she felt were
swallowed up in the joy of his coming home. A few
days later she had a telegram from him, telling of his
arrival in hospital at Eastbourne, and by this time Mrs.
Beatup had recovered sufficiently to resent the fact that
it had been sent to Thyrza and not to her.</p>

<p>Everyone was glad that Tom was at Eastbourne, as it
could be reached from Sunday Street in a few hours by
carrier’s cart and train. The very next morning Mrs.
Beatup and Mrs. Honey set out together, the latter with
a basket of eggs and flowers, and her pockets bulging
with Player’s cigarettes, the former nursing a weighty
dough-cake, beloved of Tom in ancient times, and so
baked that she fondly hoped he would never notice the
nearly total absence of sugar and plums. Thyrza looked
very unlike herself in a close-fitting blue jersey and
knitted cap; Mrs. Beatup wore what she called her Sunday
cape, which is to say the cape she would have worn
on Sundays if she had ever had the leisure to go out,
likewise her Sunday bonnet (similarly conditioned), made
of black straw and bearing a good crop of wheat.</p>

<p>The two women went by carrier’s cart to Hailsham,
where they took the train, arriving at Eastbourne soon
after one. They went first to a creamery, where they
rather hesitatingly ordered poached eggs and a pot of
tea. The eggs were stale and the tea had not that
“body” which their custom required. Mrs. Beatup
began to wonder what Tom was getting to eat—if this

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>

was what you got when you paid for it, what did you
get when you didn’t pay for it? she’d like to know.</p>

<p>She was a little relieved at the sight of Tom, looking
much fatter and browner and better in hospital than
she had ever seen him outside it. He looked happy,
too, with his broad face all grins to see them, his mother
and sweetheart. And since he looked so brown and well
and happy, she wondered why it was that she wanted
so much to cry.</p>

<p>Thyrza did not want to cry. She held Tom’s hand,
and laughed, and was quite talkative, for her. She
made him tell her over and over again how he had been
wounded, and how they had taken him to the base hospital
and then to Boulogne, and then in a hospital ship
all signed with the cross to Blighty. Mrs. Beatup made
up her mind that next time she would come alone.</p>

<p>And so she did—much to the surprise of her family,
who had hitherto found her full of qualms and fears even
at the thought of a visit to Senlac.</p>

<p>“I mun have my boy to myself whiles I’ve got the
chance,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked Ivy tactlessly, “I reckon he’d sooner
have you separate—he’ll be wanting Thyrza aloan a bit.”</p>

<p>“Will he, miss? That aun’t why I’m going different
days. We aun’t all lik you wud your kissings and loverings.
I wish to goodness you’d git married and have
done.”</p>

<p>“And taake some poor boy away from his mother,”
mocked Ivy. “I wouldn’t be so cruel.”</p>

<p>Her mother made a swoop at her with her open hand,
but Ivy dodged, and ran off, laughing good-naturedly.</p>

<p>None of the other Beatups ever went to see Tom at
Eastbourne. The journey was too expensive, and they
were sure to have him home on leave before long. Mrs.
Beatup went about twice a week, with various messages

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>

from the rest of the family muddled up in her head. She
would sit beside him, holding his hand, strangely delicate
with sickness, between her own hard, cracked, work-weary
ones, wishing that they could find more to say to
each other, and at the same time cherishing those numbered
moments when she could have him to herself.
Thyrza went oftener, shutting up shop with a recklessness
that would have ruined a less personal business.
Tom’s only other visitor was the Reverend Mr. Sumption.</p>

<p>He came one afternoon to inquire about Jerry, but
Tom could not tell him much. Jerry kept away from
him, and the little that Beatup knew of his doings he
was anxious to conceal from his father.</p>

<p>“Maybe now he’s out there he’ll get on better,” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“Better? He’s always done well,” said Mr. Sumption
loftily. “He’ll have to do unaccountable well if he does
better. Don’t think, Tom, that I came to you because
I doubted my son, but he was never much of a letter-writer,
and now, being busy and all....”</p>

<p>That night Tom lay awake an hour or so, thinking of
parents. It was queer how they stuck to their children.
His mother, now, coming all this way to see him, though
she was nervous of the journey and had very little money
to spend on it.... Mr. Sumption, too, standing up for
that lousy tyke of a Jerry.... Would he ever feel like
this for one of his own flesh—not only when that one lay
helpless and dependent on him, but had gone out from
him and chosen his own path? “Even as a father pitieth
his children ...” so the Bible said, and seemingly there
was no bound or end to that pity. Perhaps one day he
would feel it in his own heart (the curve of Thyrza’s
arms made him think of a cradle). He remembered what
Mr. Sumption had said to him long ago, the night before

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>

he joined up—“You’ll understand a bit of what I feel
... some day when you’re the father of a son.”</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Perhaps it was the inactivity of the days that made
Tom lie awake so much at night. He generally had an
hour or two to wait for sleep, and it seemed as if in those
hours his thoughts jumped and raced in a way they
never did by daylight. It was in those hours that he
formed his resolution to marry Thyrza before he went
back to France. When he left hospital he would probably
have a fortnight or so at home, and they could be
married at once by licence. Then, he felt, with a sudden
swallowing in his throat, he would have had his little bit
of life, even if Fritz cut it short before he could see those
arms he loved become the cradle he had dreamed them.</p>

<p>The future meant even less to him now than the past.
An almighty present ruled the world in those days, for
it was all that a man could call his own. Lord! if that
crump had dropped a few yards nearer, he might have
lost the chances he was grabbing now. He wondered
how a year ago he could ever have dreamed and dawdled
over his love for Thyrza, put off its declaration to a vague
and distant time which might never be. It was queer
how he had counted on the future then, made plans for
doing things “sometime.” The last year had taught him
how close that sometime stood to Never. Not that Tom
felt any forebodings. Indeed, he had the optimistic
fatalism of most soldiers. He was safe until a shell came
along with his number on, and then—well, many better
chaps’ numbers had been up before his. Meantime, it
was his business to seize the present hour and all it contained,
nor, when he planted, think of gathering, nor in
the seed-time dream of harvest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He never doubted Thyrza’s readiness, and was a little
surprised when she mentioned things like “gitting some
cloathes,” and “having the house done.” Experience
had not yet taught her to mistrust the future—for her
to-morrow always came, and must be decently prepared
for. However, when she saw how desperately Tom was
set on marriage, she brushed aside the scruples of habit
with a heroism they both of them failed to see.</p>

<p>“I’ll marry you soon as you come hoame, dear, and
then we can have a bit of honeymoon.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go away. I’ll take you to Hastings, maybe—we’ll
git a room there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! Lik a grand couple! We mun’t go
chucking the money away.”</p>

<p>“We woan’t chuck it all away, but we’ll chuck a fair-sized
bit. I doan’t git much chance of spending out
there.”</p>

<p>She looked at him tenderly.</p>

<p>“To think as I ever thought you wur slower nor me!”</p>

<p>“I wur a gurt owl,” said Tom. “Lord! if I’d a-gone
West, and never so much as kissed you....”</p>

<p>“But you did kiss me, dear—in the shop, the evenun
afore you went away.”</p>

<p>“Twur only your hand, and I wur all quaaking like a
calf.”</p>

<p>Thyrza sighed.</p>

<p>“It wur a lovely kiss.”</p>

<p>The Beatups were naturally indignant at Tom’s
decision. To them it savoured of undue haste, if not of
indecency. Courtships in Sunday Street usually lasted
from two to ten years. Indeed, Maudie Speldrum had
been wooed for fifteen years before she took matters into
her own hands and proposed to Bert Pix. Tom had not
been engaged to Thyrza six months. What did they
want to get married for? And what was Tom but a lad?—a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>

mere child in his mother’s eyes—a calf that Mrs.
Honey was leading to market, all ignorant (as she could
not be) of what lay ahead. In Sunday Street, marriage
was the end—the end of love, the end of youth—and
mixed with Mrs. Beatup’s jealousy of the other woman
and suspicion of her motives, was the desire to keep her
son a little longer in the frisky meadows of his boyhood
before he was led to those lean pastures she knew so well.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>About the middle of March, Tom was moved to a
convalescent hospital at Polegate, and a fortnight later
sent home. Worge gave him a big hail, and the whole
family, including Thyrza, sat down to a supper which
was supposed to outshine the best efforts of hospital.
That supper was not only a welcome but a farewell.
When he had eaten two more in the muddle of his kin,
he would eat a third in quiet, alone with Thyrza. The
few necessary preparations for his marriage had been
made, and the room was booked in Hastings for the third
day from now. His happiness made him dreamy, and
also tender towards those he was to leave, for though he
had not realised his mother’s jealousy of his sweetheart,
he vaguely understood that it would hurt her to lose
him, as lose him she must when he went to this other
woman’s arms. So he held her hand under the table
oftener and longer than he held Thyrza’s, and kissed her
good night without being asked.</p>

<p>The next day Harry took him to see the spring sowings.
They were finished now, and the chocolate acres
lay moist and furrowed in a muffle of misty April sunshine.
Harry, more thickset and sinewy than of old,
tramped a little behind his brother, as a workman after
an inspector, with sidelong glance at Tom’s brown, stubborn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>

profile, anxious to see if praise or delight could be
read there.</p>

<p>Tom was indeed delighted with the fruits of Harry’s
industry, swelling in soft, scored curves from Worge’s
southern boundaries at Forges Wood to the northern
limits of the Street. But he was also aghast.</p>

<p>“You’ll never have the labour to kip and reap this—and
you’ve bruk up grass!”</p>

<p>“I can manage valiant till harvest, and then I’ll git
extra hands. As for the grass, ’twur only an old-fool’s
idea that it mun never be ploughed.”</p>

<p>“And I reckon ’tis a young-fool’s idea to plough it,”
said Tom rebukingly.</p>

<p>“The newspaaper said as grass-lands mun be bruk up
now, to maake more acres.”</p>

<p>“And wot does the paaper know about it?”</p>

<p>“A lot, seemingly.”</p>

<p>“It aun’t lik to know more than men as have worked
on the ground all their lives, and their faathers before
’em. Any farmer ull tell you as it’s hemmed risky to
plough grass.”</p>

<p>“The paaper never said as it wurn’t risky, but it said
as farmers must taake some risks these times, and git
good crops fur the country, and help on the War.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t you go vrothering about the War, youngster.
It aun’t no concern of yourn—and I reckon it woan’t
help us Sussex boys much if our farms go to the auctioneer’s
while we’re away.”</p>

<p>“Worge woan’t go to the auctioneer’s. You spik lik
faather wud his faint heart. And a lot of good it’ll do
if you chaps beat the Germans out there and we have to
maake peace ’cos we’re starving wud hunger at home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’ll be no starving—you taake it from me.
We’ll have ’em across the Rhine in another six months,
so ’kip the home-fires burning till the lads’ returning,’
and doan’t go mucking up the farm fur the saake of a
lot of silly stuff you read in the paapers.”</p>

<p>But Harry stuck doggedly to his idea—</p>

<p>“I mun try, Tom—and I’ll never git the plaace sold
up, fur we’re spending naun extra save fur the seed and
a bit of manure. I go unaccountable wary, and do most
of the wark myself, wud faather to help me on his good
days, and Juglery and Elphick stuck on jobs as they can’t
do no harm at. It’ll do Worge naun but good in the end—wheat’s
at eighty shilling a quarter, and guaranteed—and
anyhow, I tell you, I mun try.”</p>

<p>Tom was impressed.</p>

<p>“Well, Harry, I woan’t say you aun’t a good lad.
But it maakes me unaccountable narvous. Here have
I bin toiling and sweating this five year jest to kip the
farm together, and now you go busting out all round and
saying it ull win the War. Wot if we chaps out there
doan’t win, t’aun’t likely as you will. Howsumdever....”</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>Tom’s marriage was on the Thursday of Easter week.
All the morning a soft teeming fog lay over the fields,
drawing out scents of growth and warmth and life.
Worge lay in the midst of it like the ghost of a farm, a
dim grey shadow on the whiteness, and the voices of her
men came muffled, as in dreams. Towards noon the
sunshine had begun to eat away the mist—it grew yellower,
streakier, and at last began to scatter, rolling up
the fields in solemn clouds, balling and pilling itself
against the hedges, melting into the April green of the
woods; and then suddenly it was gone—sucked up into
the sky, sucked down into the earth, living only in a few
drops in the cups of violets.</p>

<p>The Bethel stared away across the fields to Puddledock.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>

For some time its roof, with the chipped Georgian
pediment, had risen above the mist. Then the
grim windows had come out to stare, and then the
tombstones that grew round its feet, leaning and tottering
among the chapel weed.</p>

<p>Tom and Thyrza were to be married at the Bethel.
This had caused some surprise in the neighbourhood,
as the Beatups had always been “Church”; but friendship
and convenience had led to the decision—friendship
for the Reverend Mr. Sumption, because Tom knew him
better than Mr. Poullett-Smith, and was sorry for him on
account of Jerry, convenience because the chapel was
close at hand, and the makers of the wedding breakfast
would have time to run across and witness the ceremony,
which they could not have done had it taken place at
Brownbread Street, two miles away.</p>

<p>The only one to whom these reasons seemed inadequate
was Nell. To her the proceeding was not only
heretical but mean—her affection for the Church had
always been led by taste rather than belief, and her attitude,
which she had considered (under instruction) as
that of an orthodox Anglican, was in reality that of an
Italian peasant, who looks upon his church as his drawing-room,
a place of brightness to which he can go for
refuge from the drabness of every day. Her opposition
to the chapel marriage was based on an emotion similar to
what she would have felt for the party who, with the
chance of eating and drinking out of delicate china in
the drawing-room, chose to devour their food out of
broken pots in the scullery. She did not acknowledge
this, any more than she acknowledged the motive which
fed uneasily on Mr. Poullett-Smith’s inevitable disgust;
she talked to Tom about his duty as a Baptized Churchman,
and was both surprised and grieved to find that the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>

War seemed to have destroyed what little sense of this
he had ever had.</p>

<p>“I tell you as it’s all different out there. There aun’t
no church and chapel saum as there is here. You stick
to church on Church Parade down at the base, but
when you’re up in the firing line, there’s a queer kind
of religion going around. You hear chaps praying as
if they wur swearing and swearing as if they wur praying,
and in the Y.M. plaace they have sort of holy sing-songs
wud priests and ministers all mixed up; and I’ve
heard a Catholic priest read the English funeral over one
of us, and I’ve seen a rosary on a dead Baptist’s neck.
Church and chapel may be all very good for civvies, but
you can’t go vrothering about such things when you’re
a soldier.”</p>

<p>Nell was hurt and frightened by these sayings. She
had an idea that any danger or suffering would only
make a man cling closer to the Sanctuary. It was terrible
to think that at the first earthquake Peter’s Rock cracked
to its foundations. A defiant loyalty inspired her, and at
first she made up her mind not to go to the wedding, but
she could not resist the temptation of asking Mr. Poullett-Smith’s
advice, and he thought she had better attend,
and pray for the backsliders. He also earnestly bade her
distrust any appearance of cracks in Peter’s Rock, and
she went away comforted, with shining eyes and burning
cheeks, and her church standing firmer than ever on the
rock which was neither Peter nor Christ, but her love for
a very ordinary young man.</p>

<p>So all the Beatups went to the Bethel, leaving Worge
locked up and the yard in charge of Elphick. Mrs.
Beatup wore her Sunday bonnet, the wheat-crop having
been superseded, contrary to all the laws of rotation,
by one of small green grapes. Both Ivy and Nell had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>

new gowns, Ivy looking squeezed and unnatural in a
sky-blue cloth, which together with a pair of straight-fronted
corsets, she had bought at a Hastings dress
agency—Nell pretty and demure in a grey coat and
skirt, and one of those small towny-looking hats which
seemed to find their way to her head alone in all Dallington.
Mus’ Beatup, with Harry and Zacky, smelled
strongly of hair-oil and moth-killer, and Harry had
nearly scrubbed his skin off in his efforts to get out of
it the earth of his new furrows. He was considered too
young to be Tom’s best man, and the office had been
at the last moment unexpectedly filled by Bill Putland.
Bill, now a sergeant, was home on seven days’ leave,
looking very brown and smart, and Polly Sinden, who,
not having been invited with her parents to the breakfast,
had vowed she would waste no time going to the
chapel, suddenly changed her mind and appeared in her
most ceremonial hat.</p>

<p>The chapel was packed with Sindens, Bourners,
Putlands, Hubbles, Viners, Kadwells, Pixes. Mrs.
Lamb of Bucksteep was there, with Miss Marian, but
as she had not thought it necessary to put on the elegant
clothes in which she was seen gliding into church on Sundays,
her presence was regarded as an affront rather
than an honour; Mrs. Beatup would have dressed herself
in her best for any Bucksteep wedding, and thought that
the squire’s wife might have done the same for her.
Also, she came in very late, and her entrance was mistaken
for that of the bride by many folk, who shot up
out of the pew-boxes, only to be disappointed by the sight
of Mrs. Lamb’s faded, powdered features behind a
spotted veil, and Miss Marian swinging along after her
with a tread like a policeman. “I reckon my feet are
smaller than hers,” thought Nell, “for all that I’m only

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>

a farmer’s daughter.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Sumption came out of the vestry, and stood
under the pulpit to wait for the bride. He looked more
like a figure of cursing than of blessing—black as a rook,
with his thick curly hair falling into his eyes, yet not
quite hiding the furrows which the plough of care had
dragged across his forehead. There was a rustle and a
flutter and a turning of heads, as Thyrza came up the
aisle on the arm of the bachelor cousin who was giving
her away. She wore a grey gown like a March cloud,
and carried a bunch of flowers, and the congregation
whispered when they saw that she had sleeked her
feathery hair with water, so that it lay smooth behind
her ears, which were round and pink like those of mice.
“It didn’t look like Thyrza,” everyone said—and perhaps
that was why Tom was so loutishly nervous, and
nearly broke Bill Putland’s heart with his fumblings and
stutterings.</p>

<p>Thyrza was nervous too, her head drooped like an
over-blown rose upon its stalk, and Mr. Sumption’s
manner was not of the kind that soothes and reassures.
He shouted at the bride and bridegroom, and “thumped
at” various members of the congregation who whispered
or (later in the proceedings) yawned. He was
not often asked to officiate at weddings, and had apparently
decided to make the most of this one, for he
wound up with an address to the married pair so lengthy
and apocalyptic that Mrs. Beatup became anxious as
to the fate of a pudding she had left to “cook itself,”
and rising noisily in her pew creaked out through a
silence weighted with doom. “And whosoever hath
not a wedding garment,” the minister shouted after her,
“shall be cast into the outer darkness, where there is
weeping and gnashing of teeth”—for which Mrs. Beatup
never forgave him, as she had spent nearly three shillings
on retrimming her bonnet, “and if her cape wurn’t

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>

good enough fur him, she reckoned he’d never seen a
better on the gipsy-woman’s back.”</p>

<p>The service came to an end at last, and the congregation
pushed after the bride to see her get into the cab
drawn by a pair of seedy greys, which would take her
the few yards from the chapel to the farm. The breakfast
was to be at Worge, for Thyrza had no kin besides
the bachelor cousin, and it was considered more fitting
that her husband’s family should undertake the social
and domestic duties of the occasion. The feast was
spread in the kitchen, which had been decorated with
flags, lent for the afternoon from the club-room of the
Rifle Volunteer. The unsugared wedding-cake was a
terrible humiliation to Mrs. Beatup, who felt sure that,
in spite of her repeated explanations, everyone would put
it down to poverty and meanness instead of to the tyranny
of “Govunmunt.” However, she had restored the balance
of her self-respect by providing wine (at eighteen-pence
the bottle).</p>

<p>There was much laughter and good-humour and the
wit proper to weddings as the guests squeezed themselves
round the table. Even Mr. Sumption’s five-minute
grace, in which he approvingly mentioned more than one
dish on the table, but added to his score with Mrs. Beatup
by referring to the wine as poison and “the forerunner of
thirst in hell,” was only a temporary blight. The bride
and bridegroom alone looked subdued, their sleek heads
drooping together, their hands nervously crumbling their
food—also Ivy, who was heard to say in a hoarse whisper
to Nell, “If I can’t go somewheres and taake my stays
off I shall bust.” However, in time she forgot her constriction
in flirting with Thyrza’s bachelor cousin, who
had pale blue eyes, bulging out as if in vain effort to catch
sight of a receding chin, and was exempt by reason of
ruptured hernia from military service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual healths were drunk, and the sight of other
people drinking—for he himself would take only water—seemed
to intoxicate Mr. Sumption, and he forgot the
cares that had made his black hair as ashes on his head—his
sleepless anxiety for Jerry, and the crying in him of
that day which shall burn the stubble—and became merry
as a corn-fed colt, laughing with all his big white teeth,
and paying iron-shod compliments to Thyrza and Ivy
and Nell, and even Mrs. Beatup, who maintained, however,
an impressive indifference. Bill Putland made the
principal speech of the afternoon, and looked so smart
and handsome, with his hair in a soaring quiff and a
trench-ring on each hand, that Ivy might have plotted to
substitute his arm for Ern Honey’s round her waist, if
she had not been too experienced to fail to realise that
he was about the only man in Dallington she could not
win with her floppy charms.</p>

<p>In the end all was cheerful incoherence, and just as the
sunshine was losing its heat on the yard-stones, the bride
and bridegroom rose to go away. A trap from the Volunteer
would drive them to the station, and they climbed
into it through a flying rainbow of confetti, which stuck
in Thyrza’s loosening hair, and spotted her dim gown
with colours.</p>

<p>Amidst cheering and laughter the old horse lurched
off, and soon Thyrza’s grey and Tom’s dun were blurred
together in the distance, which was already staining with
purple as the air thickened towards the twilight. The
guests turned back into the house, or scattered over fields
and footpaths. Ivy rushed upstairs to take off her stays,
and Bill Putland swaggered home between his parents,
with a flower in his button-hole and plans in his heart for
an evening at Little Worge. The Reverend Mr. Sumption
went off with Bourner to the smithy. The blacksmith
had a shoeing and clipping to do, and the minister

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>

would sit and watch him in the red, hoof-smelling
warmth, and lend an experienced hand if occasion
needed. Mus’ Beatup, his tongue all sour with the Australian
wine, took advantage of the general flit to creep
along the hedge to the Rifle Volunteer, there to wait for
the magic stroke of six and unlocking of his paradise.
Mrs. Beatup was the last to leave the doorstep. She
thought she could hear the old horse clopping on the
East Road, and when her eyes no longer helped her to
follow her son, she used her ears. She remembered that
earlier occasion when she had gone with him to the end
of the drive and kissed him there. He had wanted her
then; he did not want her now—his good-bye kiss had
been kind yet perfunctory. Another woman had him—a
woman who had never suffered pain or discomfort or
anxiety or privation for his sake. Yet her jealousy had
unexpectedly died. Somehow, to-day, all that she had
suffered for Tom when she bore him, nursed him, reared
him and bred him, seemed a sufficient reward in itself.
Her sufferings had made him what he was, and this other
woman took only what she, his mother, had made. “She
never went heavy wud him, nor bore him in pain, nor lay
awaake at night wud his screeching, nor thought as he’d
die when he cut his teeth, nor went all skeered when he
took the fever.... So thur aun’t no sense in vrothering.
Reckon he’ll always be more mine nor hers, even if
I am never to set eyes on him agaun.”</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>Tom and Thyrza came back from Hastings in a few
days. They talked as if they had been away for weeks,
and indeed it had seemed weeks to them—not that any
moment had faltered or dragged, but each had held the
delight of hours, and each hour had been a day of new

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>

wonder. Perhaps the dazzle was brightest for Tom—Thyrza
could remember an earlier honeymoon, which
had held no presage of darkness to follow, and she
slipped back pretty easily into the old habit of having
a man about her; but for Tom even the traces of her
here and there in the room, her hat thrown down, her
petticoat trailing over a chair, the dim scent of clover
that hung on her pillow, making her bed like a field, all
joined to bind him with her enchantment, to drug him
with an ecstasy which had its sweet foundation in the
commonplace.</p>

<p>When they came back to Sunday Street the honeymoon
did not end. Contrariwise, it seemed to wax fuller
in the freedom of the old ways. Even sweeter than the
sense of passionate holiday was the taking up of a common
life together, the daily sharing of food and work and
rest, the doing of things he had done a hundred times
before, but never like this. Thyrza’s little cottage had
been hung with new curtains, and some unknown hand—which
afterwards unexpectedly proved to be Nell’s—had
filled it with flowers on the evening of their return.
Bunches of primroses, violets and bluebells stuffed the
vases in bedroom and parlour, and the soft fugitive scent
of April banks mixed with the scent of lath and plaster
which haunts old cottages, and the more spicy, powdery
smells of the shop.</p>

<p>The days were warm and drowsy, and the fields lay
in a muffle of sunshine, their distances all blurred with
heat. Round every farm the orchards rolled in pink-stained
clouds of bloom, and the young wheat was green
as a rainy sunset. The wind that brought the mutter
of the guns, brought also the bleating of lambs from the
pastures; scents seemed to hang and brood on the air,
or drift slowly from the woods—scents of standing water
and budding thorn, of hazel leaves hot in the sun, and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>

soft mixed fragrances of gorse and fern, of cows, of
baking earth, of currant bushes in cottage gardens....</p>

<p>Towards evening Tom and Thyrza usually closed the
shop, and came out—either for a stroll up to Worge to
see his family, or for some more adventurous excursion
to Brownbread Street, or Furnacefield, or up to the
North Road and the straggle of old Dallington. They
had one or two quite long walks, for a new enterprise
had kindled in them both, and for the first time there
was mystery and allure in some shaky signpost at the
throws, or a little lane creeping off secretly. One day
they walked as far as Brightling, past the obelisk, through
the shuttling dimness of Pipers Wood and up Twelve
Oaks Hill by strange farms to the sudden clump of
Brightling among the trees. They went into the churchyard
where the yews spread shadows nearly as dark as
their own blackness and strange white peacocks perched
on the tombstones, with shrill, unnatural cries. There
was also a huge cone-shaped object, built of damp stones
and thickly grown with moss, and Thyrza unaccountably
took fright at this, and the peacocks, and the shadows and
the trees, and walked for most of the way home with
her head under Tom’s coat.</p>

<p>He did not often think of when this time should end,
of the day that crept nearer and nearer to him over
drowsing twilights and magical, green sunrises. He knew
that a month hence all this delight would be a memory,
that between him and the spurge-thickening fields of May
would lie all the life of ugly adventure into which fate
had pitched him—and Thyrza would come to him only
on scraps of paper, in puffs of scent, in fugitive dreams,
in a passing light in some other girl’s eyes.... But
he was too simple and too happy to let thoughts of the
future spoil the present, besides, his habit of disregarding
the future now stood his friend. He would not see the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>

clover in bloom, but saw it in the green—deep, rippling,
gleaming, like the sea—he would miss the hay, but now
he could see the buttercups under the moon, so yellow
that they seemed to paint the sky and turn the moon to
honey; Thyrza might in a month’s time be a memory,
belong to phantasy, but now she was a woman solid and
close, his woman, the maker of his home, the maker of
himself anew.... Once his mother had borne him, and
now it seemed as if this woman had borne him again,
into a new experience, a new happiness, a new wonder—so
perfect and complete that sometimes he almost felt as
if it did not matter whether he held it for ever or for a
day.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>On his last evening, he went up to Worge to say good-bye.
He felt already as if he did not belong to the
place. Harry’s drastic dealings with the tilth seemed
to have taken the fields away from him—he no longer
felt even a distant guardianship of those brown-ribbed
acres which had been green when he worked on them.
He felt, too, with a sense of estrangement, the dirt and
litter of the house, the muddling business which at six
o’clock had Ivy swilling out the scullery and Mrs. Beatup
still struggling with the washing. Thyrza never did a
stroke of housework after dinner, and yet her morning’s
tasks were never hurried; she never had Ivy’s flushed,
red face and tousled hair, or Mrs. Beatup’s forehead
shiny with sweat.</p>

<p>His family were conscious of this—conscious that he
now had a standard of comparison by which to measure
their short-comings, and it made them sulkily suspicious
in their attitude. He was already the alien—the bird
that has left the nest, the puppy that has grown up and
gone a-hunting on his own. But this sense of estrangement

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>

only seemed to make his parting sadder, for he
vaguely felt as if he had left them before he need, had
already divided himself from them by an earlier good-bye,
of which this was only the echo and the ghost.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup enquired politely after Thyrza, and sent
Ivy out to fetch in the others. Zacky climbed on Tom’s
knee and asked him to send him home a German helmet,
and Harry—whose heart was really very warm and loving
towards Tom—stood shyly behind his chair and could
not speak a word. Mus’ Beatup gave Tom an account
of the Battle of the Ancre, but failed to create the usual
respectful impression.</p>

<p>“You see, faather, I was out there, and I know that
it happened different. St. Quentin aun’t anywhere near
the Rhine.”</p>

<p>“There’s more’n one St. Quentin, saum as there’s
more’n one Mockbeggar, and more’n one Iden Green.
How do you know as there’s no St. Quentin on the
Rhine? You’ve never bin there, and you’ll never be
there, nuther.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ll be there before I’m many months older.”</p>

<p>“You woan’t,” said Mus’ Beatup solemnly, “it’s more
likely as the Germans ull be crossing the River Cuckmere
than as you’ll ever be crossing the River Rhine. Now, be
quiet, Nell, and a-done do, fur I tell you it’s bin proved
as we’ll never git to the River Rhine, so where’s the sense
of going on wud the war, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p>“To prevent the Germans crossing the River Cuckmere,”
snapped Nell.</p>

<p>“Oh, doan’t go talking such tar’ble stuff,” moaned
Mrs. Beatup. “If the Germans caum here I’d die of
fits.”</p>

<p>“They woan’t come here,” said her husband, “and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

we’ll never git there, so wot’s the sense of all this vrother,
and giving up our lads and ploughing up our grass and
going short of beer, all to end where we started? If
this war had bin a-going to do us any good, it ud a-done
it before now, surelye; but it’s a lousy, tedious, lamentaable
war, and the sooner we git shut of it the better.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must be going,” said Tom, standing up. He
felt rather angry with his father, who, he thought, talked
like a “conscientious objector,” and was prostrating his
mighty intellect to base uses. “But maybe the beer has
addled him—he’s had a regular souse this winter, by his
looks.”</p>

<p>He said good-bye to the family, refusing his mother’s
invitation to stay to supper, as he had promised to take
Thyrza for a walk that evening. However, he asked her
to come with him to the door, as there was something he
wanted to say to her alone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup felt pleased at this mark of confidence, but
all Tom had to say as he kissed her on the threshold
was—</p>

<p>“Mother, if anything wur to happen to me ... out
there, you know ... you’d be good to Thyrza?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom—you aun’t expecting aught?”</p>

<p>“I hope not, surelye—but how am I to know?”</p>

<p>Her face wrinkled for crying.</p>

<p>“You didn’t use to spik lik that....”</p>

<p>“Come, mother—be sensible. There aun’t no sense
spikking different, things being wot they are. I dudn’t
use to be married ... it’s being married that maakes a
chap think of wot might happen.”</p>

<p>“You’d want me to taake Thyrza to live here?...”</p>

<p>“Reckon I wouldn’t. She’ll have her liddle bit of
money, thank God, and maybe a pension besides. It
aun’t money as I’m thinking of—it’s just—it’s just as
she’ll break her heart.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll break mine, too, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Tom groaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re a valiant help to me, mother. I ask you a
thing to maake me a bit easier, and all you do is to
vrother me the more.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t you go abusing your mother, Tom—wud
your last breath. If Thyrza’s heart gits broke I’ll give
her a bit of mine to mend it with—but no good ever
caum of talking of such things.”</p>

<p>“I woan’t talk of them no more. Only, it had to be
done—you see, mother, there might be a little ’un as
well as Thyrza....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, a liddle baby fur you!”</p>

<p>He blushed—“There aun’t no knowing, and I’d be
easier if....”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’d justabout love a liddle grandchild. You
need never fret over that, Tom. I’d give my days to a
liddle young un of yourn.”</p>

<p>He kissed her, and they parted in love.</p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>He hurried back to Thyrza, and they shut up the
shop, and went out to the field by the willow pond. A
green, still dusk lay over the fields and sky; no stars
were out yet, but the chalky moon hung low over the
woods of Burntkitchen. The distant guns were silent,
only the bleating of lambs came from the Trulilows, and
every now and then a burst of liquid, trilling, sucking
melody from a blackbird among the willows.</p>

<p>“Hark to the bird,” said Thyrza.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s got a nest full of liddle ’uns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“And a liddle wife as can’t sing—funny how hen-birds
never sing, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Thyrza, I wish as I cud maake a home fur you,
dear.”</p>

<p>“Wotever maakes you think of that? The birds’ nest?
Reckon I’ve got a dentical liddle home.”</p>

<p>“But it’s wot you’ve always lived in. I never built
it for you.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t you go fretting over that. I’d be lonesome
wudout the shop, Tom—I doan’t think as I’ll ever want
to be wudout the shop. And we’ve bin so happy there
together. It’s saum as if you’d built it fur me, since
you’ve maade it wot it never was before.”</p>

<p>He drew her close to him, sleek, soft, heavy, like a
little cat, and leaned his cheek against her hair.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’ll always think of you in it.... I’ll see
you setting up in the mornun wud your eyes all blinky
and your hair streaming down—and I’ll see you putting
on the kettle and dusting the shop, and maybe having
a bit of talk over the counter wud a luckier chap than
me. And all the day through I’ll see you, and in the
swale you’ll be putting your head out for a blow of air,
and there’ll be the lamp in the window behind you ...
and then you’ll lie asleep, and the room ull be all moony
and grey, and your liddle hand ull lie out on the blanket—so,
and your breath ull come lik the scent out of the
grass ... and when you turn your body it’ll be lik the
grass moving in the wind—and I woan’t be there to see
or hear or touch or smell you.”</p>

<p>His arm tightened round her breast, and she leaned
against him as if she would fuse her body into his, share
its travels, hardships and dangers. The stars were creeping
slowly into the sky, dim and rayless in the thick
Spring night, which had put a purple haze into the zenith,
and made the great moon glow like a copper pan. The
fields were blooming with a soft yellow—the waters of
the pond had a faint gleam on their stagnation, and the
willows were like smoke with a fire in its heart, their
boughs pouring down in misty grey towards the water,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>

with points and sparks of light here and there, as the
radiance danced among their leaves.</p>

<p>The swell of the field against the eastern constellations
was broken by the gable of the shop, rising over
the hedge and pointing to the sign of the Ram. Tom’s
England—the England he would carry in his heart—had
widened to take in that little humped roof of moss-grown
tiles. It held not only the willow pond and the
woman beside it, but the home where together they had
eaten the bread and drunk the cup of common things.
It was not perhaps a very lofty conception of fatherland—not
even so high as Harry’s conception of a country
saved by his plough. Tom’s country was only a little
field-corner that held his wife and his home, but as he
sat there under the stars, he felt in his vague, humble
way, that it was a country a man would choose to fight
for, and for which perhaps he would not be unwilling
to die.</p>

<h2>PART IV: IVY</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">TOWARDS
June the country bounded by the Four
Roads woke to a certain liveliness. A big camp
had sprung up on the outskirts of Hailsham, on
the ridge above Horse Eye, and the excitement spread
to Brownbread Street, Sunday Street, Bodle Street,
Pont’s Green, Rushlake Green, and other Streets and
Greens—and cottage gardens were a-swing with lines of
khaki shirts, “soldiers’ washing,” taken in with high delight
at an army’s big spending.</p>

<p>The girls of the neighbourhood began to take new
sweethearts with startling quickness. They came, these
strangers from the North, leaving their girls behind them,
and the girls of the South had lost their men to camps
in France and Midland towns. No doubt some kept faith
with the absent, but the spirit of the days mistrusted
space as it mistrusted time, and the wisdom of love took
no more account of happiness a hundred miles away than
of happiness a hundred months ahead. There were wooings
and matings and partings, all played out in the few
spare hours of a soldier’s day, in the few spare miles of
his roaming, under the thundery thick sky of a Sussex
summer, when heat and drench play their alternate havoc
with the earth.</p>

<p>In those days Ivy Beatup lifted up her head. She
had had a dull time since Kadwell and Viner and Pix
went out to France. Thyrza’s cousin had turned out
miserable prey—he had actually proposed himself as her
husband to her father and mother, bringing forward most

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>

satisfactory evidence of a more than satisfactory income,
derived from Honey’s Suitall Stores in Seaford. Thus
the strain between Ivy and her family was increased, and
her presence at home became a burden of reproach. They
could not see why she refused to bestow her splendid
healthy womanhood on this poor creature, why she would
rather scrub floors and gut fowls than sit with folded
hands in his parlour—that she had “taken him on”
merely to kill time, and that it wasn’t her fault if he
chose to treat her seriously and make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>“You’ll die an old maid,” said her mother. “You’ll
go to the bad,” said her father, and Ivy, who had no
intention of doing either, felt angry and sore, and longed
to justify herself by a new love-affair more gloriously
conducted.</p>

<p>When the soldiers came to Hailsham, she saw her
chance, and resolved to make the most of it. She
persuaded Harry to take her into the town on market-day,
and also found that she preferred the “pictures”
there to those at Senlac. Polly Sinden refused to abet
her—Bill Putland had given her distinct encouragement
on his last leave, and Polly decided that in future discreet
behaviour would become her best. So she refused
to prowl of an evening with Ivy, either in Hailsham or
Senlac, and Ivy—since no girl prowls alone—had to take
up with Jen Hollowbone of the Foul Mile, the same whom
Bob Kadwell had jilted, but who, soothed by time and a
new sweetheart, had generously forgiven her rival, especially
as Bob had once again transferred his affections,
and was now no more Ivy’s than Jen’s.</p>

<p>The two girls went into Hailsham on market-days, and
strolled that way of evenings, winning the South Road
by Stilliands Tower and Puddledock, through the little
lanes and farm-tracks that were now all thick with June
grass, and smelled of hayseed and fennel. With grass

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

and goose-foot sticking to their skirts, and their hair
spattered with the fallen blossoms of elderflower, they
would come out on the South Road, where the dust swept
through the twilight before the wind. Warm and flushed,
with laughing eyes, and arms entwined, and slow proud
movements of their bodies, the girls would stroll past the
camp gates, leaning clumsily together and giggling. The
men would come pouring out after the day’s routine, seeking
what diversion they could find in lane or market-town.
It was in this way that Ivy met Corporal Seagrim
of the Northumberland Fusiliers.</p>

<p>He was a tall, dark giant, well past thirty, with a becoming
grizzle in his hair, over the temples. His face
was brown as a cob-nut, and his speech so rough and
uncouth in the northern way that at first Ivy could
hardly understand him. They met in the market-place.
He had a companion who paired with Jen—an under-sized
little miner, with a pale face and red lips, but good
enough for Jen, since she already had a boy in France.
Of course Ivy had several boys—but they were no more
than good comrades, the interchangers of cheery postcards
on service and cheery kisses on leave. If she had
had a boy like Jen’s, she would have been more faithful
to him than Jen was, but she was free to do as she liked
with Seagrim—free when they met in the market-place,
that is to say, for by the time they said good-bye at Four
Wents under the stars, she was free no longer.</p>

<p>They had gone to the “pictures,” but soon the moving
screen had become a dazzle to Ivy, the red darkness an
enchantment, the tinkling music an intoxication. Seagrim’s
huge brown hand lay heavily on hers, and her
limbs shook as she leaned against his shoulder, almost in
silence, since they found it hard to understand each
other’s speech. The man thrilled and confused her as no
other had done—whether it was his riper age, or his

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>

almost perfect physical beauty, or some strange animal
force that thrilled his silence and slow clumsy movements,
she did not seek to tell. Self-knowledge was
beyond her—all she knew was that she could never give
him the careless chum-like affection she had given her
boys, that between them there never would be those light
hearty kisses which she had so often taken and bestowed.
She felt herself languid, troubled, full of a dim glamour
that brought both delight and pain. The music, the red
glow all seemed part of her sensation, though before she
used scarcely to notice them, except to hail a popular tune
or an opportunity for caresses.</p>

<p>When the show ended, the soldiers offered to walk
with the girls as far as Four Wents, where the Puddledock
lane joins the South Road. Jen and the miner
walked on ahead, she holding stiffly by his arm, in a
manner suitable to one demi-affianced elsewhere. Ivy
and Seagrim followed. They did not speak; his arm
was about her, and every now and then he would stop
and pull her to him, dragging her up against him in
silent passion, taking from her lips kiss after kiss. The
aching passionate night looked down on them from the
sky where the great stars jigged like flames, was close
to them in the hedges where the scented night-wind fluttered,
and the dim froth of chervil and bennet swam
against the hazels. For the first time Ivy seemed to feel
a hushed yet powerful life in the country which till then
she had scarcely heeded more than the music and red
lamps of the show. Now the scents that puffed out of
the grass made her senses swim, the soft sough of the
wind over the fields, the distant cry of an owl in Tillighe
Wood, made her heart ache with a longing that was half
its own consummation, made her lean in a drowse of
ecstasy and languor against Seagrim’s beating heart, as
he held her in the crook of his arm, close to his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Wents the parting came, with a loud ring of
laughter from Jen, and a “pleased to ha’ met yo’”
from the miner. But Ivy clung to her man, her eyes
blurred with tears, her throat husky and parched with
love as she murmured against his thick brown neck—</p>

<p>“I’ll be seeing you agaun?...”</p>

<p>“Aye, and yo’ will, li’l lass, li’l loove” ... he swore,
and straightway made tryst.</p>

<p>When he was gone the night still seemed full of him—his
strength and his beauty and his wonder.</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Ivy was in love. The glamour had transmuted her
country stuff as surely as it transmutes more delicate
substance. The spring rain falls on the thick-stalked
hogweed as on the spurred columbine, and the divine
poetry of Love had given to her, as to a more tender
nature, its unfailing gift of a new heaven and a new
earth.</p>

<p>Her whole being seemed gathered up into Seagrim,
into a strange happiness which had its roots in pain.
For the first time pain and happiness were united in
one emotion; when she was away from him, pain was
the strong partner, when with him, then happiness prevailed—and
yet not always, for sometimes in his presence
her heart swooned within her, and her face would grow
pale under his kisses and a moan stifle in her throat, and
also, sometimes, when he was away, a strange ecstasy
would seize her, and all her world would shine, and her
common things of slops and guts and mire become beautiful,
and the very thought of his being dazzle all the
earth....</p>

<p>She never told him of this, indeed she herself scarcely
realised it. She felt in her thoughts a soft confusion,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>

a happy bewilderment, a sweet ache, and everything was
changed and everyone spoke with a new voice—the very
kitchen boards were not the same since she met Seagrim,
and her family had queer new powers of delighting and
grieving her. “I must be in love,” she said to herself,
and straightway bought her man a pound of the best
tobacco at the Shop.</p>

<p>She was very good to him. Her hearty, generous
nature found relief in spending itself upon him. She
seldom came to the meeting-place without some present
of tobacco or food—she did him a dozen little services,
mended his clothes, marked his handkerchiefs, polished
his buttons and his boots. Strangely spiritual as the
depths of her love might be, its expression was entirely
practical and animal. To serve him and caress him was
her only way of revealing those dim marvels that swam
at the back of her mind.</p>

<p>The man himself was bewitched. Her generosity
touched him, and it would be a strange fellow indeed
who would not love to hold her to him, sweet and
tumbled like an over-blown flower, and take the softness
of her parted lips and sturdy neck. Ivy was like the
month in which he wooed her—July, thick, drowsy,
blooming, ripe, lacking the subtlety of spring and the dignity
of autumn, but more satisfying to the common man
who prefers enjoyment to promise or memory.</p>

<p>They met most evenings, he walking eastward, she
westward, to Four Wents; there, where the tall stile
stands between two shocks of fennel, they would lean
together in the first charm of tryst, the dusk thickening
round them, hazing road and fields and barns and
bushes, their own faces swimming up out of it to each
other’s eyes, like reflections in a pond—hers round and
flushed under her tousled hair, like a poppy in a barley-field,
his brown and predatory with its hawk-like nose and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>

piercing eye under the grizzled curls. Then the dusk
would smudge them into each other and they would
become one in the swale....</p>

<p>He led her up and down the little rutted lanes, under
a violet sky where the stars were red and the moon was
a golden horn. The thick fanning of the July air brought
scents of hayseed and flowering bean, the miasmic perfume
of meadowsweet, the nutty smell of ripening corn,
and the drugged sweetness of hopfields. All round them
would hang the great tender silence of night, the passionate
stillness of the earth under the moon, and their
poor broken words only seemed a part of that silence....
“My loove, my li’l lass.” ... “I love you unaccountable,
Willie.” ... “Coom closer, my dear.” ...
The wind rustled over the orchards of Soul Street, and
the horns of the moon were red, and the sky thick and
dark as a grape, when they came back to the tall stile at
the throws, and parted there with caresses which love
made groping and vows which love choked to whispers.</p>

<p>On Sundays they met more ceremonially, pacing up and
down the road at Sunday Street, from the shop to the
Rifle Volunteer—which was the parade-ground of those
girls of the parish who had sweethearts. Here Jen Hollowbone
showed her Ted and Polly Sinden her Bill, and
Ivy Beatup showed her Willie, walking proudly on his
arm, smiling with all her teeth at the girls whose sweethearts
were away and at the girls who had no sweethearts
at all.</p>

<p>She even brought him to Worge once or twice, but
her family did not like him. This was partly because
they were still the champions of the rejected Ern Honey,
and partly because they resented his gruff manner, and
harsh, rumbling speech. He did not shine in company—he
was for ever boasting the superiority of Northumberland
ways over those of Sussex, and even told Mus’

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>

Beatup that he “spake like a fule” on American Intervention.
He horrified Nell by drinking out of his saucer—a
depth below any of the family’s most degrading collapses—and
offended Harry and Zacky by taking no
notice of them or interest in the farm. Indeed the only
being at Worge he seemed to care about—not excepting
Ivy, whom he almost ignored on these occasions—was
Nimrod, the old retriever; to him alone he would smile
and be friendly, hugging the old black head against his
tunic, and patting and slapping Nim’s sides till he became
demoralised by this unaccustomed fondling and frisked
about with muddy paws—which was all put down to Seagrim
for unrighteousness in his account with Mrs.
Beatup.</p>

<p>“Wot d’you want wud un, Ivy?” she asked once—“a
gurt dark tedious chap lik that, wud never a good
word for a soul—not even yourself, he doan’t sim to
have—and a furriner too.”</p>

<p>“He aun’t a furriner.”</p>

<p>“He aun’t from these parts, like some I cud naum.
You’re a fool if you say no to a valiant chap lik Ernie
Honey and taake up wud a black unfriendly feller as
no one here knows naun about.”</p>

<p>“Well, he doan’t have to have his inside tied up wud
a truss lik a parcel of hay, caase it falls out.”</p>

<p>“You hoald your rude tongue. Wot right have you
to know aught of Ern Honey’s inside? And better a
inside lik a parcel of hay than a heart lik a barnyard
stone. He’s a hard-hearted man, your sojer—cares for
naun saave a pore heathen dog wot he brings spannelling
into the kitchen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>“He cares for me.”</p>

<p>“It doan’t sim lik it wud his ‘Eh, lass?—eh, lass?’
whensumdever you spik. Reckon you maake yourself
cheap as rotten straw when you git so stuck on him.”</p>

<p>“Who said I wur stuck on him?—he aun’t the fust
I’ve kept company with.”</p>

<p>“No, he aun’t. You’re parish talk wud your goings
on. You’ll die an oald maid in the wark’us, and bring
us to shaum—and Harry ull bring us to auction, and Tom
ull be killed by a German, and bring us to death in sorrow.
All my children have turned agaunst me now I’m
old,” and Mrs. Beatup began to cry into her apron.</p>

<p>Ivy’s big arms were round her at once....</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Relations between Ivy and Nell had always been a
little uneasy. Ivy was tolerant and good-humoured, but
could not always hide the contempt which she felt for
Nell’s refinements, while Nell, though she did not despise
Ivy, hated her coarseness—particularly since she could
never see it through her own eyes alone, but through
others to which it must appear even grosser than to
herself.</p>

<p>One evening Nell came in from school, and as she
took off her hat before the bit of glass on the kitchen
wall, could see the reflection of Ivy munching her tea,
which she had started late, after a day’s washing. Her
sleeves were still rolled up, showing her strong arms,
white as milk to the elbow, then brown as a rye-bread
crust. Her meadow-green dress was unbuttoned, as if
to give her big breast play, and her neck was thick and
white, its modelling shown by bluish shadows. “She’s a
whacker!” thought Nell angrily to herself, then suddenly
turned round and said—</p>

<p>“Jerry Sumption’s here.”</p>

<p>“Lork!” said Ivy, biting off a crust.</p>

<p>“I met him,” continued Nell, “and he knows you’re

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>

going with Seagrim.”</p>

<p>“Well, wot if he does?”</p>

<p>“It might be awkward for you. He seemed very much
upset about it.”</p>

<p>“Wot fur dud you go and tell un?”</p>

<p>Nell sniffed.</p>

<p>“I didn’t tell him. But your love-making isn’t exactly
private.”</p>

<p>“No need fur it to be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—it might be better for you as well as
for us if the whole parish didn’t know so much about
your affairs.”</p>

<p>“And I reckon you think as no one knows about
yourn?”</p>

<p>Nell flushed—</p>

<p>“Leave my affairs alone. I’ve none for you to meddle
with.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—you aun’t sweet on Parson—not you, and
nobody knows you go after un!”</p>

<p>“Adone-do wud your vulgar talk,” cried Nell furiously,
forgetting in her anger to clip and trim her blurry
Sussex speech. “I’ve warned you about young Sumption,
and it aun’t my fault if you have trouble.”</p>

<p>“There woan’t be no trouble. I’ve naun to do wud
Jerry nor he wud me—I got shut of him a year agone.”</p>

<p>All the same, she was not so easy as her words made
out. It was evil luck which had brought Jerry Sumption
back at just this time. He was bound to be a pest
anyhow, though perhaps if his jealousy had not been
roused he might have had enough sense to keep away.
Now he would most likely come and make a scene.
Even though she would not be his girl, he could never
bear to see her another man’s; he might even try to
make mischief between her and Seagrim—be hemmed
to the gipsy! At all events he would be sure to come
and kick up trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>She was partly right. Jerry came, but he did not
make a scene. He turned up the next morning, looking
strangely dapper and subdued. Ivy interviewed him
in the outer kitchen, where she was blackleading the
fireplace. It spoke much for the sincerity of his passion
that he had hardly ever seen his charmer in a presentable
state—she was always either scrubbing the floor, or
cooking the dinner, or washing the clothes, or cleaning
the hearth. To-day there was a big smudge of black
across her cheek, and her hair was tumbling over ears
and forehead, from which she occasionally swept it back
with a smutty hand.</p>

<p>Contrariwise, Jerry was neat and dressed out as she
had never seen him. His puttees were carefully wound,
his buttons were polished, his tunic was brushed, his
hair was sleek with water. He stood looking at her in
his furtive gipsy way, which somehow suggested a cast
in his fine eyes which were perfect enough.</p>

<p>“Ivy....”</p>

<p>She had decided that he should be the first to speak,
and had let the silence drag on for two full minutes.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“I’ve come—I’ve come to ask you to forgive me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll forgive you sure enough, Jerry Sumption—but
I aun’t going wud you no more, if that’s wot you mean.”</p>

<p>“You’ve taken up with another fellow.”</p>

<p>“That’s no concern of yourn.”</p>

<p>“But tell me if it’s truth or lie?”</p>

<p>“It’s truth.”</p>

<p>“And you love him?”</p>

<p>“Maybe I do.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s face went the colour of cheese.</p>

<p>“Then you’ll never come with me again, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I justabout woan’t”—Ivy sat up on her heels and
looked straight into his dodging eyes—“I’ll forgive you

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>

all, but I’ll give you naun—d’you maake that out? I
cud never have loved you, and you’ve shown me plain as
mud as you aun’t the kind of chap a girl can go with
for fun. If you’re wise you’ll kip awaay—we can’t be
friends. So you go and find some other girl as ull do
better fur you than I shud ever.”</p>

<p>“If there hadn’t been this chap——”</p>

<p>“It ud have bin the saum. I’m not your sort, my
lad, for all you think.”</p>

<p>“Will this other chap marry you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell naun about un. He’s no consarn of yourn,
as I’ve said a dunnamany times.”</p>

<p>“Ivy, when I was in France, I thought to myself—’Maybe
if I’m sober and keep straight, she’ll have me
back.’”</p>

<p>“I’m middling glad you thought it, Jerry, fur it wur
a good thought. You’ll lose naun by kipping straight
and sober, so you go on wud it, my lad.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care, if I can’t get you.”</p>

<p>“That’s unsensible talk. I’m not the only girl that’s
going—thur’s many better.”</p>

<p>“Reckon there is—reckon I’ll get one for every day
of the week. No need to tell me girls are cheap—I
only thought I’d like one that wasn’t, for a change.”</p>

<p>“Doan’t you talk so bitter.”</p>

<p>“I talk as I feel. You’ve settled with this chap, Ivy?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you a dunnamany times. Wot maakes you
so thick?”</p>

<p>He did not answer, but turned away, and walked out
of the room with a stealthy, humble step, like a beaten
dog. Ivy’s heart smote her—she could not let him go
without a kind word.</p>

<p>“Jerry!” she called after him. But he did not turn
back—and then, unaccountably, she felt frightened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>It was odd that Jerry’s cowed retreat should have
caused her more fear than his swaggering aggression—nevertheless,
all that day she could not get rid of her uneasiness,
and with the arbitrariness of superstition linked
the evening’s catastrophe with the earlier foreboding.</p>

<p>She had run down to the Shop, to buy some washing
soda, and have a chat with Thyrza, and on her return
was met in the passage by Nell, who looked at her hard
and said—</p>

<p>“There’s someone come to see you—a Mrs. Seagrim.”</p>

<p>Ivy’s heart jumped. She wished that there had not
been quite such a wind to blow about her hair, and that
she had had time to mend the hole in her skirt that morning.
If Willie’s mother had come to inspect his choice
... howsumdever, he had often spoken of his mother
as a kind soul.</p>

<p>But the woman in the kitchen with Mrs. Beatup was
only a few years older than Ivy—a tall, slim creature,
with reddish hair, and a beautiful pale face. She was
dressed like a lady, too, in a neat coat and skirt, with
gloves and cloth-topped boots. Ivy felt the blood drain
from her heart, and yet she had anticipated Mrs. Beatup
with no definite thought when the latter said—</p>

<p>“Ivy, this is Corporal Seagrim’s wife.”</p>

<p>“Pleased to meet you,” Ivy heard someone say, and
it must have been herself, for the next moment she was
shaking hands with Mrs. Seagrim.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, during which the two
women stared at Ivy, then the corporal’s wife remarked,
with a North-country accent that came startlingly from
her elegance, that it was gey dirty weather.</p>

<p>“Thicking up fur thunder, I reckon,” said Mrs.
Beatup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yo get it gey thick and saft down here, A’m thinking.”</p>

<p>“Unaccountable,” said Mrs. Beatup, and squinted
nervously at Ivy.</p>

<p>Ivy’s wits had at first been blown to the four winds,
and she sat during this conversation with her mouth
open, but gradually resolve began to form in her sickened
heart; she felt her brain and body stiffen—she would
fight....</p>

<p>“A chose a bad week t’coom Sooth,” started Mrs.
Seagrim, “but ’twas all the choice A had—A hae t’roon
my man’s business now he’s sojering. Yo’ mither tells
me, Miss Beatup, as nane here knaws he’s marrit. But
marrit he is, and has twa bonny bairns.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Ivy—“he toald me.”</p>

<p>“He toald you!” broke in Mrs. Beatup. “You said
naun to me about it.”</p>

<p>“I disremember. He wur only here the twice.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Seagrim looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>“Weel, maist folk didn’t sim t’knaw. A took a room
in Hailsham toon, and the gude woman said as how
t’Corporal had allus passed for a bachelor man, and
was coorting a lass up t’next village.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she thinks he wur a-courting me,” snapped
Ivy, “but he dud naun of the like. He toald me he
was married the fust day I set eyes on un.”</p>

<p>“Weel, that was on’y reet. So many of those marrit
sojer chaps go and deceive puir lasses. A hear there’s
been a mort of trouble and wickedness done that
way.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Ivy—“women are gurt owls, most of
them.”</p>

<p>“And,” continued Mrs. Seagrim, “it’s only reet and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>

kind of the wives of such men to go and tell any poor
body as is like to be deceived by them.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough. But your trouble’s thrown away
on me. I knew all about un from the fust.”</p>

<p>“Weel, A’ve done ma duty ony way,” and Mrs. Seagrim
rose, extending a gloved hand, “and A’m reet glad
as Seagrim was straight with yo’, when he seems to have
passed as single with everyone else.”</p>

<p>“It must be a tar’ble trial to have a man lik that,”
said Ivy. “He’ll cost you a dunnamany shilluns and
pounds if you’ve got to go trapesing after him everywheres,
to tell folk he’s wed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Seagrim smiled.</p>

<p>When Ivy had shown her out of the front-door, she
would have liked to escape to her bedroom, but Mrs.
Beatup filled the passage.</p>

<p>“Ivy—you might have toald me. I maade sure as
he’d deceived you.”</p>

<p>“And I tell you he dudn’t. He toald me he wur wed,
and about his childer, and that dress-up hop-pole of a
wife of his’n.”</p>

<p>“And you went walking out wud a married man, for
all the Street to see!”</p>

<p>“Why not? There wur no harm done.”</p>

<p>“No harm! I tell you it wurn’t simly.”</p>

<p>“He’d no friends in these parts, and a man liks a
woman he can talk to.”</p>

<p>“He’d got his wife, surelye.”</p>

<p>“Not hereabouts. He wur middling sick wud lonesomeness.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup sniffed.</p>

<p>“Well, you can justabout git shut of him now. Your
faather and me woan’t have you walking out wud a
married man. So maake up your mind to that.”</p>

<p>Ivy muttered something surly and thick—the tears
were already in her throat, and pushing past her mother,
she ran upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>Once alone, her feelings overcame her, and she threw
herself upon the bed, sobbing with grief and rage. Seagrim
had deceived her, had meant to deceive her—that
was quite plain. Though he had never definitely spoken
of marriage, he had quite definitely posed to her as a
single man. She gathered from Mrs. Seagrim that he
made a habit of these escapades. Lord! what a fool
she had been—and yet, why should she have doubted
him whom she loved so utterly?</p>

<p>Her hair, matted into her eyes, was soaked with tears,
as she rolled her head to and fro on the pillow, thinking
of the man she had loved, loved still, and yet hated
and despised. He had played her false—she was unable
to get over this fact, as a more sophisticated nature
might have done. Her confidence, her devotion, her passion,
he had paid with treachery and lies. She had not
fought her battle with Mrs. Seagrim in his defence—at
least not principally—she had fought it to save herself
from humiliation in the eyes of this woman, of her
mother, and of Sunday Street.</p>

<p>Yet she cried to him out of the deep—“Oh, Willie,
Willie....” She thought of him in his strength and
grizzled beauty—she remembered particularly his neck
and his hands. “Oh, Willie, Willie....” She had
loved him as she had loved no other man. No other
man had filled the day and the night and brought the
stars to earth for her and made earth a shining heaven.
Her love was crude and physical, but it is one of the
paradoxes of love that the greater its materialism the
greater its spiritual power, that passion can open a mystic
paradise to which romance and affection have not the
key. Ivy had seen the heavens open to this clumsy soldier
of hers—to this man who had tricked her, bubbled her,
brought her to shame.</p>

<p>She wondered if he knew of his wife’s visit—perhaps

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>

he was with her now. Did he love her?... and those
two youngsters up in the North—a moan dragged from
her lips. His wife was dressed like a lady, but she talked
queer, though maybe they all talked like that up North.
Had she believed Ivy when she said she had always
known Seagrim was a married man? Had her mother
believed her? Would Sunday Street believe her?</p>

<p>She sat up on the bed, and pushed the damp hair
back from her eyes. She would face them out, anyhow.
No one should point at her in scorn—or at Seagrim,
either, even though she could never trust him or love
him again. She would give the lie to all who mocked
or pitied. No one should pry into her aching heart.
Ivy Beatup wasn’t the one to be poor-deared or serve-her-righted.
She crossed the room, and plunged her face
into the basin, slopping her tear-stained cheeks with cold
water. Then she brushed back and twisted up her hair,
smoother her gown, and went downstairs with no traces
of her grief save an unnatural tidiness.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Ivy held her bold front for the rest of that week. Her
secret portion of sorrow and craving she kept hid. Her
floors were scrubbed and her pans scoured no worse for
lack of that glory which makes like the silver wings of
a dove those that have lien among the pots.... She
still had strength to cling to the empty days, to serve
through the meaningless routine that had once been a
joyous rite.</p>

<p>Everyone had heard about Seagrim now, and had also
heard that Ivy Beatup had not been deceived, but had
known about his wife from the first. Some believed her,
accounting for her silence by the fact that her family
would have interfered had they known she was walking

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

out with a married man. These for the most part called
Ivy Beatup a bad lot, though her sister-in-law Thyrza
stood up for her, declaring Ivy’s friendship with the
Corporal could only have been innocent and respectable—but
of course Thyrza was now allied with the Beatups,
and would be anxious for their good name. A large proportion
of the street, however, did not believe Ivy’s version
of the story—they would have her tricked, deluded—betrayed,
they hinted—and found an even greater delight
in pity than in blame.</p>

<p>All joined in wondering what she would do the following
Sunday. She would not have the face to parade
the man as usual. Perhaps Mrs. Seagrim was still at
Hailsham—perhaps, even if she was not, the Corporal
would not dare show his face after what had happened
or, if he did, surely the girl would not be so brazen as
to trot him out now that she knew all the parish knew
she was a bad lot—or a poor victim.</p>

<p>However, when Sunday came, Ivy appeared in her best
blue dress, and on Seagrim’s arm, as if nothing had happened.
Her eyes were perhaps a little over-bright with
defiance, her cheeks a little over-red for even such a full-blown
peony as her face, but her manner was assured, if
not very dignified, and her grins as many-toothed as on
less doubtful occasions.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, Ivy had not meant to offer such a
public challenge to a local opinion. She had made up
her mind that Seagrim would not appear at all, or in a
very subdued condition. However, on Friday she had
a letter of the usual loving kind, excusing his absence
during the week on the score of extra duty and asking
her to meet him at Worge gate next Sunday morning—“with
her boy’s fondest love” and a row of kisses.</p>

<p>Ivy’s teeth bit deep into her lip as she read this letter.
He was still deceiving her, though now, thank the Lord,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>

he was also deceived himself. He did not know his wife
had been to see her, and doubtless Mrs. Seagrim had now
gone back to “the business”—a corn-chandler’s in Alnwick.
Ivy wondered why she had kept her own counsel,
but no doubt the “dressed-up hop-pole” knew best how
to deal with her man. If she betrayed her plot it might
have led to friction between an affectionate husband and
wife, and she probably felt that she had “settled” Ivy.</p>

<p>The girl’s blood ran thick with humiliation—both the
man and the woman had shamed her. Doubtless they
loved each other well, though he, with a man’s greediness,
had wanted another woman in her absence. He could
never have meant to marry Ivy—his intentions must
always have been vague or dishonourable. As for the
wife, having spent some of the cash left over from her
clothes, in running down South to look after him, she
had no doubt been satisfied with warning Ivy and coaxing
her husband, and had then gone back to her flourishing
shop. True that this letter hardly pointed to the success
of her tactics, but Ivy knew too much about men to attach
great importance to it—Seagrim was just the sort of man
who would have a girl wherever he went, and yet always
keep the first place in his heart for the woman who had
also his name. She, Ivy, was probably only a secondary
attachment to fill the place of the other, and no doubt in
that other’s absence; he would make every effort to keep
her—but she was a stop-gap, an interlude, to him who
had been her all, and filled the spare moments of one who
had filled her life.</p>

<p>She forced herself to bite down on this bitter truth,
and swallowed it—and it gave her strength for the
course she meant to take.</p>

<p>She found Seagrim leaning against Worge gate, sucking
the knob of his swagger stick, and gazing at her with
shining long-lashed eyes of grey. For a moment the sight

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>

of him there, his greeting, the husky tones love put into
his voice, his sunburnt, hawk-like strength, all combined
to make her falter. But she was made of too solid stuff
to forget his callous deception of her, which he still maintained,
drawing her arm through his with a few glib lies
about extra duty and the sergeant. Contempt for him
stabbed her heart and eyes, and for a few moments she
could neither look at him nor speak.</p>

<p>They went to their usual parade ground, marching
to and fro between the Bethel and the Shop, and Ivy’s
confidence revived with her defiance of public opinion.
“They’ll see I doan’t care naun fur wot they think,”
she said to herself, and met boldly the outraged eyes
of Bourners and Sindens and Putlands. It was a hot
day, and there was a smell of dust in the air, which
felt heavy and thick. The sun was dripping on Sunday
Street, making the red roofs swim and dazzle in a yellow
haze; the leaves of the big oaks by the forge drooped
with dust, and the Bethel’s stare was hot and angry, as
if its lidless eyes ached in the glow.</p>

<p>Ivy decided that she might now end her ordeal of the
burning ploughshare. She had strutted up and down
a dozen times in front of her neighbours, defying their
gossip, their blame and their pity. “I done it—now I
can git shut of un,” and her gaze of mixed pain and
contempt wandered up to his brown face as he walked
beside her, talking unheard in his booming Northumberland
voice.</p>

<p>“It’s middling hot in the Street—let’s git into the
Spinney.”</p>

<p>He kindled at once—it would be good to sit with her
on trampled hazel leaves, to lie with their faces close
and the green spurge waving round their heads in a
filter of sunlight. Usually these suggestions came from
him, by the rules of courting, but he loved her for the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>

boldness which could break all rule even as it lacked
all craft. He slid his hand along her arm, and pressed
it, with joy at the quiver she gave.</p>

<p>The Twelve Pound spinney stood about thirty yards
back from the Street, behind the Bethel, and was reached
by a little path and a stile opposite the Horselunges. As
they passed the inn, Ivy saw Mrs. Breathing opening the
door and the shutters for the Sunday’s short traffic, and
at the same time saw ahead of her a dusty khaki figure
ambling towards the sign with the particular padding
unsoldierly tread of Jerry Sumption.</p>

<p>“He’s on the drink, now’s he knows as he can’t git
me,” she thought—“the bad gipsy.” Then a feeling
of regret and hopelessness came over her. Here were
two men whose love she had muddled—one who had
hurt her and one whom she had hurt. Was love all
hurting and sorrow? For the first time the careless
game of a girl’s years became almost a sinister thing.
Her hand dragged at Seagrim’s arm, as if unconsciously
and despite herself her body appealed to the man her
soul despised ... then she lifted her eyes, and looked
into Jerry’s as he passed, trotting by with hanging head
and queer look, like a mad dog ... yes, love was a
tar’ble game.</p>

<p>The black, still shadows of Twelve Pound Wood
swallowed her and Seagrim out of the glare. The clop
of hoofs and bowl of wheels on the Street came as from
a great way off, and the hum of poised and darting insects,
thick among the foxgloves, seemed to shut them
into a little teeming world of buzz and pollen-dust and
sun-trickled green. Seagrim stood still, and his arm slid
from the crook of Ivy’s across her back, drawing her
close. But with a sudden twisting movement she set herself
free, standing before him in the path, with the tall
foxgloves round her, flushed and freckled like her face,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>

and behind her the pale cloud of the bennet heads like
melting smoke.</p>

<p>“Kip clear of me, Willie Seagrim—I’ll have no truck
wud you. I’ve met your wife.”</p>

<p>The man, slow of speech, gaped at her without a
word.</p>

<p>“Yes. She caum round to our plaace three days
agone, and shamed me before my mother. But I said
I knew as you wur married, and to-day I walked out
wud you to show the foalkses here I aun’t bin fooled.
Now I’ve shown’ em, you can go. I’m shut of you.”</p>

<p>“Ivy—yo’re telling me that my Bess——”</p>

<p>“Yes—your Bess, wud gloves and buttoned boots
and——” She checked herself. “Yes, she caum, and
tried to put me to shaum. But I druv her off, surelye;
and now I’m shut of you, fur a hemmed chap wot fooled
me wud a lie.”</p>

<p>“But A no harmed yo’——”</p>

<p>“Harmed me!”—she gasped.</p>

<p>“Dom that Bess for a meddlesome fule. Oh, she’s
gey canny, that Bess. But Ivy, li’l Ivy, yo’ll no cast
me off for that?”</p>

<p>“Why shud I kip you?—you’ve bin a-fooling me.
You maade as you wur a free man, and all the while
you wur married. I—I loved you.”</p>

<p>“And yo’ kin lo’ me still....” He sought to take
her, but she pushed him off.</p>

<p>“Reckon I can’t. Reckon as I’ll never disremember
all the lies you’ve said. And you spuk of loving me ...
knowing all the whiles.... Oh, you sought to undo me!
Reckon I’m jest a gurt trusting owl, but it wur middling
cruel of you to trick me so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ivy—by God A sweer——”</p>

<p>“Be hemmed to your silly swears. I’ll never believe
you more.”</p>

<p>“But yo’ll no cast me off fur a wumman up
North....”</p>

<p>“I don’t care where she be. She’s yourn—and you
hid her from me. If you’d toald me straight, maybe I—but ...”</p>

<p>“Yo’ na speered of me. Why should A have spoken?”</p>

<p>“You did spik—you spuk as a free man.”</p>

<p>“A was a fule—yo’ made me mad for you.”</p>

<p>His eye was darkening, and the corners of his mouth
had an angry twist.</p>

<p>“You toald me as extra duty kept you away last
week,” continued Ivy, “and it wurn’t—it wur your wife.
Reckon you love her and I’m only a girl fur your spare
days. You’d kip me on fur that.”</p>

<p>“A’ll keep yo’ on for naething. If yo’ don’t like me,
yo’ can go.”</p>

<p>“It’s you who can go. I’m shut of you from this day
forrard. You git back to Hailsham this wunst and never
come here shaming me more.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ll be shamed if I go. Better for yo’ if I stay.”</p>

<p>“If you stay you’ll shaum me furder, fur you’ll shaurn
me wud my own heart. Git you gone, Willie Seagrim,
and find a bigger fool than me.”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and her heart sickened with
jealousy, knowing that her loss to him could not be so
serious as his to her, since he had his beautiful pale Bess,
with her red hair and stooping back, whom all the time
he had loved more than he loved Ivy, because she was
his children’s mother and had rights which he respected.
He would soon forget Ivy; perhaps he would find another
girl to solace his spare hours, but anyhow he would
forget her. The thought almost made her hold him back,
cling to him, and seek to wrest him from the other
woman with her self-confident possession. But she was
withheld by her sense of outrage, and by a queer pride

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>

she had always had in herself, a rustic straightness which
had gone with her through all her many amours. To
surrender now could only mean disgrace, since she felt
that in some odd way it meant surrender to Bess as well
as to Bess’s master. If she became Seagrim’s woman,
which she must be now, or nothing, Bess would somehow
triumph, and triumph more utterly than if she threw him
off with scorn. Besides, he had fooled her and lied to
her; he was not worth having—let him go, though her
heart bled, and her bowels ached, as she watched him
march off away from her, shaking his shoulders in
jaunty swagger, the sunlight gleaming on his grizzled
hair, the curls she had loved to pull. She could have
called him back, and he would have come, but her lips
were shut and her throat was dry. He vanished round a
bend of the path, and all that was left of him was a
crunching footstep, heavy on last year’s leaves. Then
that too was gone, and with a little moan Ivy slid down
among the foxgloves and bennets, and sobbed with her
forehead against the earth.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>After a little while she pulled herself up and wiped
her eyes. Her head ached and Twelve Pound Wood was
blurry with her tears. The sun struck down upon her
back, baking, aching, mocking her with the thick yellow
light in which the flies danced and the pollen hung. She
wanted to creep into the shade.</p>

<p>But she must go home and save her face. It was
dinner-time, and she must join her family with her old
bravery, or they would suspect her humiliation. She rose
to her feet, smoothed her dress, dusted off the bennet
flowers and goose-foot burrs and the rub of pollen from
the foxgloves, pushed back the straggling hair under her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>

hat, wiped her eyes again, and hoped the stains and
blotches of her weeping would fade before she came to
Worge. Then she set out for the opening of the wood.
A man’s shadow lay across it, though she could not see
him as he stood behind an ash-stump. Her breathing became
shallow, and her heart thudded.... He had come
back, to find her in her weakness—he was waiting for
her.... No, it was not he, this smaller man, crouched
like a fox against the stump.</p>

<p>“Jerry,” she cried, as she turned the elbow of the path,
and met him face to face.</p>

<p>He was drunk; his eyes showed it with their gleam of
bleared stars, his flushed cheeks and dark swelled veins,
his hair hanging in a fringe over his brow, his mouth both
fierce and loose.... He lurched towards her, and she
just managed to brush past him, tumbling ungracefully
over the hurdle that shut off the wood. He must have
just come, for he had missed Seagrim—he might have
stumbled over her as she lay and cried among the
grasses.</p>

<p>She did not fall as she jumped the hurdle, but her
ankle turned, making her stagger, and by the time she
could right herself, Jerry stood before her, blocking the
way to the Street. Then she saw for the first time that
he had a hammer in his hand. Ivy gave a loud scream,
and darted sideways, scrambling through the hedge into
Twelve Pound field. Jerry was after her, without a
word, no longer the furtive, padding animal she had
despised, but the armed and terrible beast of prey that
would kill and devour the foolhardy huntress who had
roused him. She staggered up the field, too breathless to
cry, but he drew even with her in a few strides, and
grabbed her by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Stop, Ivy, and say your prayers. I’m going to kill
you.”</p>

<p>She could not speak, for her throat was dried up.
Jerry’s eyes were more of a threat than his word. They
were on fire—his skin was on fire—liquor and madness
had set him alight; and in his hand was a hammer to
hammer out her brains. She could neither cry to his
mercy nor appeal to his reason—her physical powers
were failing her, and both mercy and reason in him had
been burnt up.</p>

<p>He gave her a violent push, and she fell on her knees.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Say your prayers. I’m a clergyman’s
son, and you shan’t die without asking pardon for your
sins. I saw you go into the wood with him, as you
wouldn’t with me.... I’ll kill you quick, you shan’t
have any pain.... I loved you once, I reckon.”</p>

<p>He swung up the hammer, but he was too drunk to
take aim, and the action woke her out of the trance of
fear into which he had plunged her. She felt something
graze bruisingly down her hip—then she was scrambling
on her feet again, rushing for the hedge.</p>

<p>The hedge of Twelve Pound field is a thick hedge of
wattles and thorn. Ivy, too mad to look for a gap, tried
to force her way through it. Her head and arms stuck,
and she heard Jerry running. Then at last loud screams
broke from her—scream after scream, as he seized her
by the feet and pulled her backwards through the
brambles, leaving shreds of blue gown and yellow hair
on every twig. He pulled her out, and flung her rolling
on the grass; then the hammer swung again....</p>

<p>But the field was full of shoutings and voices, of feet
trampling round her head. Then two hands came under
her armpits, dragging her up, and she saw her father.
She saw her brother Harry, looking very green and
scared, and last of all Jerry plunging in the lock of two
huge arms, which gripped him powerless and belonged
to the Reverend Mr. Sumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take her away,” said the minister. “I’ll keep hold
of the boy.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have hurt her,” moaned Jerry. “I’m a
clergyman’s son—I’d have killed her without any pain.”</p>

<p>“Come hoame, Ivy,” said Mus’ Beatup, and began to
lead her away.</p>

<p>“Is it dinner-time?” asked Ivy stupidly.</p>

<p>Harry gave a nervous guffaw.</p>

<p>“I’ll be round and see you, neighbour,” said Sumption,
“soon as I’ve got this poor boy safe.”</p>

<p>“’Pore boy’ indeed!” grunted Mus’ Beatup. “’Pore
boy’ as ud have bin murdering my daughter if Harry and
I hadn’t had the sperrit to break your valiant Sabbath in
the Street field. Look at his gurt big murdery hammer.”</p>

<p>“He would not have used it—for the Angel of the
Lord led me to him, and it was the Angel of the Lord
who saved both him and the girl, despite your Sabbath-breaking.”</p>

<p>“Then the Angel of the Lord can saave him another
wunst—when I have him brung up for murdering.
Come along, do, Harry.”</p>

<p>Jerry was silent now, nor was he struggling. He
looked suddenly very ill, and as Ivy stumbled blindly
down the field on her father’s arm, she had a memory
of his drawn white face lolling sideways on the minister’s
shoulder.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>Two-edged disgrace struck at Ivy both at home and
in the village—for the double reason of Jerry’s assault
and Seagrim’s parade. The latter was almost the wickedest
in the Beatups’ eyes, for it had the most witnesses—the
former had no witnesses but themselves and Mr.
Sumption, though when Mus’ Beatup led Ivy home, Mus’
Putland was already climbing the stile and Mus’ Bourner

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>

running out of his door. It could be hushed up, muffled
and smoothed, whereas the whole Street had seen Ivy in
her flaunt of wedded Seagrim—“A bad ’un,” “a hussy”
she would be called from Harebeating to Puddledock.</p>

<p>“’Tis sent for a judgment on you,” said Mrs. Beatup.
“If you hadn’t gone traipsing and strutting wud that
soldier, I reckon as gipsy Jerry had never gone after you
wud his hammer.”</p>

<p>“I wurn’t a-going to show ’em as I minded their
clack,” sobbed Ivy against the kitchen table—“I said
as ‘I’ll taake him out this wunst, just to show ’em I
aun’t bin fooled, and then I’ll git shut of un.’ And I
dud, surelye.”</p>

<p>“And a valiant fool you’re looking now, my girl—run
after and murdered, or would have bin, if your
father hadn’t a-gone weeding the oats and heard your
screeching. Reckon as half the Street heard it at their
dinners. We’ll have the law of Minister and his gipsy.”</p>

<p>So they would have done, had it not been brought
home to them that “the law” would hoist them into
that publicity they wanted to avoid. If Jerry were tried
for attempted murder, all the disgraceful story of Ivy
and Seagrim would be spread abroad, not only throughout
Sunday Street and Brownbread Street and the other hamlets
of Dallington, but away north and south and east
and west, to Eastbourne, Hastings, Seaford, Brighton,
Grinstead, and everywhere the <cite>Sussex News</cite> was read.</p>

<p>So the Beatups agreed to forego their revenge on condition
that the Rev. Mr. Sumption took Jerry away for
the few days remaining of his leave, and did not have
him back at the Horselunges on any future occasion.</p>

<p>“You can’t hurt my boy without hurting your girl,”
he told them, “so best let it alone and keep ’em apart.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>

I’m sorry for what’s happened, and maybe Jerry is, and
maybe he’s not. I reckon Satan’s got him.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he has,” said Mrs. Beatup spitefully, “and
reckon when Satan gits childern it’s cos faathers and
mothers have opened the door. ’Tis a valiant thing fur a
Christian minister not to know how to breed up his own
young boy. But the shoemaker’s wife goes the worst
shod, as they say, and reckon hell’s all spannelled up wud
parsons’ children.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you don’t know how to speak to a clergyman”—and
the Rev. Mr. Sumption turned haughtily
from the wife to the husband, who was, however, big
with an attack on Sunday observance, and no discussion
could go forward till he had been delivered of it.</p>

<p>In the end the matter was settled, and the parting was
fairly friendly. The Beatups had a queer affection for
their pastor mingled with their disrespect, and admired
his muscle if they despised his ministrations. The proceedings
ended in an adjournment to the stables, where
Mr. Sumption gave sound and professional advice on a
sick mare.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>Poor Ivy felt as if she could never hold up her head
again. The very efforts she had made to avoid contempt
had resulted in bringing it down on her in double
measure. Garbled stories of her misadventure ran about
the Street. It was said that she had been walking out
with two men at once, that Seagrim had jilted her because
of Jerry and Jerry tried to do her in because of
Seagrim. There were other stories, too, some more
creditable, and some less—and they all found their way
to Worge, where they provoked the anger of her father,
the querulousness of her mother, the shrinking contempt
of Nell, and the loutish sniggers of Harry and Zacky.</p>

<p>Ivy was not a sensitive soul, but the Beatup attitude
was warranted to pierce the thickest skin. The family

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>

could not let the matter drop, and kept it up even after
those outside had let it fall in to amiable “disremembering.”
Ivy’s exuberant correspondence with the forces,
her amorous past, her scandalous future, all became subjects
of condemnation. Her people did not mean to be
unkind, but they nagged and scolded. Perhaps the balking
of their revenge on Jerry Sumption made them specially
unmerciful towards Ivy—she had to face the torrent
of the diverted stream. She had disgraced them as,
apparently, none of Mus’ Beatup’s muddled carouses or
gin-logged collapses had done. The fine, if beer-blown
flower of the Beatups had been hopelessly picked to
pieces by her wantonness and indiscretion. Nell was perhaps
the most really vindictive of the lot (for Mus’
Beatup was easy-going and Mrs. Beatup loved her daughter
through all her reproaches), because she saw in Ivy’s
disgrace another danger to her hopes. She had enough
odds against her in her poor little reedy romance without
all the spilth of Ivy’s bursting thick amours to come
tumbling over it, choking out its life. Ivy’s village
friends turned against her too, for Polly Sinden was still
trying to live up to Bill Putland, and Jen Hollowbone of
the Foul Mile remembered the theft of Kadwell and
taunted “Sarve her right.” Thyrza, her sister-in-law,
was still friendly, but though Ivy liked Thyrza, there had
never been any real confidence or comradeship between
them—the elder girl was too quiet, too settled, and had
always been lacking in that indefinite quality which makes
a woman popular with her own sex. Ivy did not respond
to Thyrza’s few tentative efforts, made, she suspected, out
of pity, and a sense of duty to Tom. Besides, her trouble
had soured for the time even her own sweet honest heart,
and the sight of Thyrza secure of a man’s love and an
even more wonderful hope, smote her with an unbearable
sense of her own failure and loneliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>For the worst of all that Ivy had to bear was her love
for Seagrim, still alive, though wounded and outraged.
Her old gay interest in young men, her comradeships
and correspondences, had faded out and could occupy
her no more. Her heart was full of a mixed dread and
hope of meeting him again. Sometimes when the purple
chaffy evenings drew down over the fields, and the smell
of ripening grain and ripening hops made sweet sick perfume
on the drowsy air, an ache which was almost madness
would drive her out into the lanes, seeking him by
the tall stile at Four Wents, where he would never come
again. The fiery horn of the moon, the jigging candles
of the stars, would glow out of the grape-coloured sky as
she went home through a fog of tears, slipping and
stumbling in the ruts, dreaming of his step beside her and
his arm about her and his bulk all black in the dimness
of the lane.... Then suddenly she would hate him for
all he had made her suffer, for all the lies he had told
her and all the truths, for the kisses he had given her and
the tears that he had cost her—and the hate would hurt
more than love, choke her and burn her, make her throw
herself sobbing and gasping into bed, where the hunch
of Nell’s cold shoulder and the polar stars that hung in
the window joined in preaching the same lesson of loneliness.</p>

<p>Then one day she made up her mind quite suddenly
to bear it no longer. “If you have much more of this
you’ll go crazy,” she said to herself, “—so git shut of
it, Ivy Beatup.”</p>


<h3>9</h3>

<p>Ivy’s disappearance was not found out till late in
the evening. In spite of the dejection and heartache
of the last week, her failure to appear at supper with a
healthy appetite was an alarming sign. It was now

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>

remembered that no one seemed to have seen her all
the evening. Mrs. Beatup burst into tears.</p>

<p>“She’s chucked herself into the pond, for sartain-sure.
You’ve bin so rough wud her, Maaster—you’ve
bruk her heart, surelye.”</p>

<p>“I rough wud a girl as has disgraced us all! I’ve
took no notice of her a dunnamany days.”</p>

<p>“That’s why, I reckon. You’ve bruk her heart. Git
along, Harry, and drag the pond, and doan’t sit staring
at me lik a fowl wud gapes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she’s only gone into Senlac to see the pictures.”</p>

<p>“And maybe she’s only run away wud that lousy
furrin soldier of hern.”</p>

<p>“I tell you she’s drownded. I feel it in my boans.
She’s floating on the water lik a dead cat. Go out and
see, Harry! Go out and see!”</p>

<p>Zacky began to howl.</p>

<p>“Adone, do, mother!” cried Harry. “You’re the one
fur the miserables. Reckon Ivy’s only out enjoying
herself.”</p>

<p>“I’d go myself,” sobbed Mrs. Beatup, “but my oald
legs feel that swummy. Oh, I can see her floating, all
swelled up!”</p>

<p>During this scene Nell had slipped out of the room.
She was now back in the doorway, saying icily—</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry. Ivy’s taken all her clothes with
her.”</p>

<p>The family took a little time to get the drift of her
words.</p>

<p>“All her clothes!” murmured Mrs. Beatup faintly.</p>

<p>“Yes—in the pilgrim-basket, so you may be sure she
hasn’t drowned herself.”</p>

<p>“She’s gone away wud that dirty soldier!” cried
Mus’ Beatup. “That justabout proves it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“It doan’t,” said his wife. “Ivy’s an honest girl.”</p>

<p>“An honest girl as walks out wud a married man fur
all the Street to see, and then goes and gits half murdered
by a gipsy!”</p>

<p>“A clergyman’s son,” corrected Mrs. Beatup. “And
it wurn’t her fault, nuther. Our Ivy may be a bit flighty,
but she’s pure as the morning’s milk.”</p>

<p>“Whur’s she gone, then? She’d nowheres to go. You
doan’t know the warld as I do, and I tell you she’s gone
wud un, and be hemmed to her. We’re all disgraced and
ull never hoald up our heads agaun.”</p>

<p>“I woan’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“You’re an obstinate oald wife—I tell you it’ll be
proved to-morrer.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go to the camp myself and find out. If Seagrim’s
gone too, then it’s proved.”</p>

<p>The family went to bed convinced, except for Mrs.
Beatup—who kept up a mulish belief in her daughter’s
honesty—that Ivy had run away with Seagrim.</p>

<p>The next morning Mus’ Beatup set out for Hailsham
to make enquiries. But he had not been fitted by nature
for a diplomatic visit to a military camp—all he did was
to fall foul of various sentries and nearly get arrested.
In the end he found himself back in the road, with nothing
gained except perhaps the fact that he was not in
the guard-room. He felt as if the whole British Army
were in league against him, the accomplice of one Corporal
in his crimes, and was scanning the scenery for a
public-house when he heard the sound of marching feet,
and a file came tramping up the road, commanded by
Seagrim himself.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup straddled across his way.</p>

<p>“Who are you? Stand clear!” cried the Corporal,
while the file marched stiffly onwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whur’s my daughter?”</p>

<p>“Stand clear—or A’ll have you put under arrest.”</p>

<p>“I want my daughter—Ivy Beatup.”</p>

<p>“Halt!” cried Seagrim to the file, which had now
marched a discreet distance ahead. “A don’t knaw owt
of your daughter. A’ve not clapped eyes on her sine
Sunday week.”</p>

<p>“She’s run away.”</p>

<p>“A don’t knaw owt.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know where she is?”</p>

<p>“A don’t knaw owt. Quick march!” and off went
he and his file in a cloud of dust, leaving Mus’ Beatup
furious and confounded.</p>

<p>“He’s a militaryist,” he mumbled, “a hemmed militaryist—treating
me as if I wur pigs’ dirt. That’s wot
we’re coming to, I reckon, wot Govunmunt’s brung us to—militaryists
and the pigs’ dirt they spannell on. Ho!
there’ll be a revolution soon”—and he floundered up the
road towards Hailsham where the sign of the Red Lion
hung across the way.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>Jerry Sumption knew nothing of Ivy’s disappearance,
for the morning after that fatal Sunday his father had
taken him off to Brighton, and from Brighton he had
gone back to France. In fact his whole notion of the
affair was hazy—inflamed by one or two unaccustomed
glasses of bad whisky and the memory of Ivy on Seagrim’s
arm, he had rushed and stumbled through what
seemed to him now a wild nightmare of phantasmagoria
from which he had waked into aching and disgrace.</p>

<p>He was sullen company during those few days at
Brighton. Mr. Sumption had chosen Brighton because
it was at a safe, and also not too expensive, distance
from Sunday Street. Moreover, he hoped it would provide

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>

some distraction for Jerry. The financial problem
had been great, but he had solved it by drawing out the
whole of his savings. He took a poor little lodging at
the back of the town, from which he and Jerry travelled
down daily by ’bus and tram to the diversions of the
sea-front.</p>

<p>It was not a quite successful holiday, which was indeed
hardly to be expected. Mr. Sumption brought
preachment to bear on Jerry’s sullenness—he did not
understand what a hazy impression the catastrophe had
made, and that to him, though not to Ivy, the scene by
Twelve Pound spinney mattered less than that earlier
scene in Forges Field. Also Mr. Sumption’s ideas of
amusement were not the same as his son’s. He decided
to risk the Lord’s displeasure and visit a Picture Palace
for Jerry’s sake, but was so scandalised by what he saw
that he insisted on leaving after half an hour’s distress.</p>

<p>“Surely it is the house of Satan with those red lights,”
he exclaimed with sundry cracks and tosses.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with red lights? You get ’em in
a forge.”</p>

<p>“But a forge is the place of honest toil—and a kinema’s
but a place of gaping and idleness and worse: three
hundred folks got together to see lovers kissing, which
is a private matter.”</p>

<p>Jerry laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>“Three hundred folk gaping at an ungodly picture,
who might be saving their souls. I tell you, boy, there
ull come a red day, that ull burn redder than any forge
or picture-house, and all the ungodly gazers shall be
pitched into it like weeds into the oven, and only the
saints escape—with the singeing of their garments.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Father, do speak cheerful. I’m that down-hearted.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you are, my poor lad—and the Lord rebuke
me if I add to your burden. This looks a godly sort
of a pastry-cook’s. Let’s go in and get some tea.”</p>

<p>The next day was the last of Jerry’s leave, and the
one that he and his father spent most happily together.
Mr. Sumption’s ideas of entertainment seemed quite hopeless
to Jerry, but during those last hours he felt drawn
closer to the being who he knew was the only friend he
had. They spent the morning on the pier, listening to
the band, and in the afternoon went by the motor-bus to
Rottingdean—a trip so surprisingly expensive that there
was no money left to pay for their tea, and while the
other excursionists sat down to long tables, they had to
wander upon the down, whence they watched the feasters,
Jerry like a forlorn sparrow and Mr. Sumption like a
hungry crow, till it was time to go home.</p>

<p>But all the while the minister could see his son growing
more dependent on him, and in his heart he thanked
the Lord. His delight at having won that much poor
show of affection blinded him a little to the pathos of
the outlaw clinging to his only prop, before he was flung
to troubles and dangers which he realised in helpless foreboding.
The chapel weed clung to the chapel stone before
it was rudely torn up and thrown out to the burning.</p>

<p>Their final parting was abusive, owing to Mr. Sumption’s
having left Jerry’s dinner of sandwiches behind at
their rooms, but the father would always have a thankful
memory of that evening when Jerry had been simple and
grateful and rather childish, and had listened to his good
advice, and had not interrupted with his cry for cheerfulness
the stream of Calvinistic warning.</p>

<p>They had sat by the big ugly window of their room,
looking out at the first dim stars pricking the sky above
Kemp Town. Jerry’s eyes were full of a mysterious
trouble as they pondered the new serenity of his father’s
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father,” he said suddenly, “you’ll watch and pray
that Satan don’t get me.”</p>

<p>“Satan can’t hurt the elect.”</p>

<p>“But maybe I’m not one of the elect. Didn’t seem like
it on Sunday, did it?”</p>

<p>“That was the Lord’s trial sent to us both—He delivered
you unto Satan for a while that you might find
His ways.”</p>

<p>“Reckon His ways are not for my finding.”</p>

<p>“I will pray for you, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Father, you promise, you swear, as you’ll never let
me go? I sometimes feel as if there was only you
standing betwixt me and hell. Reckon you’re the only
soul in all the world that cares about me.”</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>By the time Mus’ Beatup had groped his stumbling
way from Hailsham to Sunday Street, the anxieties of
Worge about Ivy were at an end. A letter had come
during the morning and was flapped in his face. He
was not sober enough to read it, nor yet too drunk to
have it read to him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="sig3">
“8 Bozzum Square,</p>
<p class="sig5">
“Hastings.
</p>

<p>“Dear Mother,—I hope this finds you well as it leaves
me at present. I got fed up as the boys say and came
here. Do you remember Ellen Apps and her folk lived
at the Fowl Mile up the Hollowbones. She is here working
on the trams, I heard from Jen, so thought I go and
ask her. She says I will get a job in a day or 2 with my
strong physic, so do not worry about me, I am with Ellen
and hope to start work next week. Having no more to
say, I will now draw to a close. Fondest love from</p>

<p class="sig2">
“Your loving daughter, <span class="smcap">Ivy</span>.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“I toald you as she’d never gone wud Seagrim!” cried
Mrs. Beatup.</p>

<p>“Umph,” grunted her husband—“but she’s gone on
the trams, which is next bad to it. Now if she’d gone
maaking munititions....”</p>

<p>“Trams is better than munititions.”</p>

<p>“No it aun’t. Fine ladies and duchesses maake munititions,
but I never saw a duchess driving a tram.”</p>

<p>“Ivy ull never drive a tram—she’d be killed, surelye.”</p>

<p>“Best thing she cud do for herself now she’s disgraced
us all—a darter of mine on the trams, a good yeoman’s
darter on the trams ... ’tis shameful.”</p>

<p>“But ’tis honest, Maaster—better nor if she’d run
away wud a man.”</p>

<p>“Maybe—but ’tis shameful honest. I’m shut of
her!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ned!—our girl!”</p>

<p>“Your girl!”</p>

<p>“You cruel, unnatural faather!”</p>

<p>“Adone do, and taake off my boots.”</p>

<p>The matter ended temporarily in sniffs and grunts,
but when Mus’ Beatup woke out of the sleep which
followed the removal of his boots, he reviewed it more
auspiciously. After all, working on the trams was better
than working in the fields—suppose Ivy had gone and
offered her robust services to some neighbouring farmer,
to some twopenny smallholder perhaps, then the yeoman
name of Beatup would have indeed been trampled into the
earth. Now trams were town work, trams were war
work, trams were engineering. In time “my darter on
the trams” began to sound nearly as well as “my son at
the front.”</p>

<p>So a letter was written in which Ivy’s choice was
deplored, though not condemned. She was invited to
come home, or if obstinate on that point, to turn her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>

attention to the more aristocratic “munititions,” but
if it must be trams, then trams it should be unreproached.</p>

<p>Ivy wrote back in a few days, saying that she had
“joined up” and enclosing a photograph of herself in
uniform. She would soon be earning thirty shillings a
week, and had taken a room of her own in Bozzum
Square. Her family had now quite forgiven her, especially
as they found the neighbourhood inclined to applaud
rather than to despise Beatup’s daughter on the
trams. Her mother would have liked her home, but Ivy
was quite firm about sticking to her job. “I’m best away
from the Street as things are, and I’ll send you five shillings
a week home, and you can get a girl with that and
what you save from my keep.” But it would have taken
two girls to make a real substitute for Ivy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup, besides the gap in her motherly feelings,
missed her terribly about the house. Her sturdy willingness
to scrub or clean, her cheery indifference to the
little indelicacies of emptying slops or gutting chickens,
her unfailing good-humour and bubbling vitality, the
rough, tender comfort she gave in hours of sorrow, all
made Ivy of a special, irreplaceable value in her mother’s
working-day. Nell refused to give up her “teachering,”
and spoke obstinately of indentures, and other irrelevant
puzzles. Anyhow her squeamishness—she even washed
the dishes with a wrinkled nose—and the delicacy of her
small soft hands would make her pretty useless in hen-house
or kitchen. Mrs. Beatup began to talk of Ivy as
much as she thought of her, and soon her family came
to find her more of a nuisance now she was away than
she had been at home in her most disruptive moments.</p>

<p>However, her forgiveness was complete, and the reconciliation
was celebrated by a solemn ride in “Ivy’s tram”
by all the Beatups. It was during the summer holidays,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>

so Nell was able to go—Mrs. Beatup wore her Dionysian
bonnet, and her husband his best Sunday blacks, Harry
and Zacky were scrubbed and collared into oafishness, the
house was shut up and left in charge of Elphick and
Juglery, as it had never been since Tom’s wedding.</p>

<p>“Ivy’s tram” was on the line from the Albert Memorial
to Ore, and ground its way through dreadful
suburbs up Mount Pleasant, past the decayed “residences”
of Hastings’ prime, slabbed with stucco and
bulging with bow-windows, now all grimed and peeled
and darkened, chopped into lodgings and sliced into flats,
not the ghost of prosperity but its rotting corpse.</p>

<p>The tram ground and screamed and swished on the
rails, and Ivy, rosy-faced under her tramwayman’s cap—with
its peak over the curl that hid her ear—came
forcing her way up the inside for fares, taking from each
Beatup its separate penny. She looked exuberantly well,
and quite happy again; she also smelled strongly of tram-oil,
and Nell’s little nose wrinkled even more than when
she had smelt of soapsuds and milk. She had a cheery
word for each one of her family, who in their turn sat
abashed, holding their tickets stiffly between finger and
thumb, their eyes slewed on Ivy as she took other passengers’
fares, answered their questions, trundled them
out, bundled them in, pulled the bell, ran up to the roof,
changed the sign, and flung a little good-humoured chaff
at Bill the motorman when they reached the terminus.</p>

<p>She had no time off till late that evening, so when the
family had ridden in state to Ore, they rode back again
to the Memorial. The parting was a little spoiled by
the crowd which was waiting to board the tram and reduced
Mrs. Beatup’s farewell embrace into something
grabbing and unseemly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-by, mother dear, and doan’t you vrother. I’m
valiant here.... Full inside, ma’am, and no standing
allowed on the platform.... Now, Nell, take care of
mother and hold her arm—she’s gitting scattery—and
adone, do, mother, for there’s too many fares on the top,
and I’m hemmed if I haven’t bitten a grape out of your
bonnet.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>12</h3>

<p>It was night before the dislocations of train and trap
brought the Beatups back to Worge. A big yellow moon
was swinging high, scattering a honey-coloured dust of
light on the fields and copses and little lanes. The
farms, hushed and shut, lay dark against their grain-fields
drooping with harvest—in some fields the corn was
already cut and shocked, each tasselled cone standing in
the moonlight beside the black pool of its shadow.</p>

<p>The Beatups were silent—owing perhaps to their congestion
in the trap. Nell was tired, and leaned against
her mother. Life seemed a very sordid trip, in spite of
the honey-coloured moon, which swung so high, the type
of unfulfilled desire. Mrs. Beatup was thinking of Ivy
and wondering if the soles of her boots were thick enough;
and Zacky, wedged between them, planned a big hunt
for conkers the next day. On the front seat, Mus’
Beatup sucked at his pipe and schemed a dash for the
Rifle Volunteer before closing time. “If the War goes
on much longer, there’ll be no more beer, so I mun git
wot’s to be had. It’s those Russians, and be hemmed to
them; reckon they’ll maake peace and never care if the
War goes on a dunnamany year. It’s the sort of thing
you’d expect of chaps wot went teetotal by Act of Parliament.”</p>

<p>Harry drove the old gelding, and as the trap lurched
from farm to farm he marked those which had cut their
grain, and which had not. They had reaped the Penny
field at Cowlease, and the old bottoms of Slivericks stood

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>

shocked beside the stream. Egypt Farm, with late hardy
sowings, had not started—Worge started to-morrow.</p>

<p>That visit to Hastings had been a holiday before the
solemn business of the year. For a long time he had
planned his reaping—trudging the fields each day, fingering
the awns, rubbing the straw. He must not cut too
early or too late. Last year the oats had stood till they
shed their seed, this year they must be caught in just the
right moment of wind and sun.</p>

<p>On the whole the crops promised well. The old
grounds of the Volunteer and the Street field had borne
splendidly—the ploughed grass-lands not so well, except
for Forges field, which, for some obscure reason, had
brought forth a rich yield from its sour furrows. On
the whole the wheat promised better than the oats, which
in spite of the varieties he had chosen had thickened in
the clays, and grown unwieldy with sedge leaves and tulip
roots.</p>

<p>The problem of harvesting had worried him for a long
time, for Mus’ Beatup absolutely refused to buy a steam
reaper-and-binder; he wurn’t going to take no risks in
war-time, and Harry must make what shift he could with
the old horse machine, which had trundled slowly round
the few acres of earlier Worge harvests, and must even
trundle round the width of this new venture. In vain
Harry pointed out the labour needed for binding—he
must get help, that was all; the family would turn to, as
it always did in harvest time. The absence of Ivy was a
hard blow—for she practically did the work of a man—but
he found an unexpected substitute in the curate, who
with the other country clergy had been episcopally urged
to lend a hand in harvest time. Mr. Poullett-Smith had
watched young Beatup’s effort with an approval which
condoned his wobblings between Church and chapel, and
felt, moreover, that his help might send a balance down

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>

on the Church side. He was a little scandalised to find
soon after that Harry had also drawn in the Rev. Mr.
Sumption—the curate’s offer put it into his head; besides,
it was just the sort of thing one asked of Mr. Sumption—it
seemed far more his job than preaching or praying.</p>

<p>The other helpers would just be the family, this time
including Nell, for where her parson went she could go
also, in spite of stained and welted hands. Elphick and
Juglery could do about one man’s work between them, and
there was a boy over school age on the loose in the
village, who was hired for ten shillings and his meals.</p>

<p>Harry had written to Tom and told him of his maturing
plans, but either his marriage had breached him from
Worge, or the fact that the disciple had gone so much
further than his master had made his anxious ardour
cool away. His latest communication had been a field
postcard, which, as he had forgotten to put a cross against
any of its various items, presented a bewildering and conflicting
mass of information, which Harry flipped into the
coals with a wry smile.</p>

<p>However, he was able to stand alone, for he dared the
chances of his new deeds. Oafish as he looked in his
Sunday suit and gasper collar, the adventure of harvest
was upon him as he jolted the old trap home under the
moon. “Behold, the fields stand white to harvest” ...
the words drifted like a cloud over his brain. These
fields that he had prepared, that his plough had torn and
his harrow broken, were fields of battle like the fields
in France. On them he had fought, for the same reason
as Tom fought the Germans, all the treacheries and assaults
of nature, her raiding winds, her storming rains,
her undermining rottenness in the soil, her blasting of
thunder and choking of heat.</p>

<p>“Reckon to-morrow’s our Big Push,” he said to his
father, rather proud of the metaphor, and was careful

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>

that the old horse did not hurry stablewards too quickly,
lest they should be home before the closing of the Rifle
Volunteer, and lose a soldier thereby.</p>

<h3>13</h3>

<p>The next day broke out of a dandelion sky above
Harebeating, but before the first pale colours had filtered
into the white of the east, Harry was on his legs, pottering
in the yard. All the little odds of farm-work must be
done early, to leave him free for the day’s great doings.
He anxiously snuffed the raw air—could its moisture,
distilled in the globes that hung on thatch and ricks, be
the warning of a day’s rain? The barometer stood high,
but, like other Sussex farmers, he had learned to distrust
his barometer, knowing the sudden tricks of turning
winds, the local rains drunk out of the marshes, the
chopping of the Channel tides. He disliked the flamy
look of the sky, the glassiness of its reflection in the
ponds ... he thought he felt a puff from the south-west.
“O Lord,” he prayed, kneeling down behind the
cowhouse door, “doan’t let it rain till we’ve got our
harvest in. If faather loses money this fall, he’ll never
let me breake up grass agaun. Please, Lord, kip it fine,
wud a short east wind, and doan’t let anyone stay away
or faather go to the Volunteer till we’ve adone. For
Christ’s sake. Amen.”</p>

<p>Feeling soothed and reassured, he went in to breakfast.</p>

<p>The family was of mixed and uncertain mood. Mrs.
Beatup was “vrothering” about what she could give
the clergymen for dinner—“not as I care two oald
straws about Mus’ Sumption, but Mus’ Smith he mun
be guv summat gentlemanly to put inside.” Zacky was
crossly scheming how best to carry through the conker

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

plan which Harry had rather threateningly forbidden.
Nell was in a nervous flutter, her colour coming and
going, her little hands curling and twitching under the
table. Mus’ Beatup was given over to an orgie of pessimism,
and before breakfast was finished had traced
Worge’s progress from a blundered harvest to the auctioneer’s.</p>

<p>“There’s too many fields gitting ripe together,” he
said drearily. “You shudn’t ought to have maade your
sowings so close. Wot you want now is a week’s fine
weather on end, and all your wark done on a wunst.
You’ll never git it, surelye—the rain ull be on you before
it’s over. Reckon the Sunk Field ull have seeded itself
before you’re at it. You shud ought to have sown it
later.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine time to think of all that now.”</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of it afore and agaun, but you’d never
hearken. You think you’ve got more know than your
faather wot wur a yeoman afore you wur born and never
bruk up grass in his life.”</p>

<p>“There’s Mus’ Sumption,” cried Mrs. Beatup, looking
out of the window. “He’s middling early—reckon
he wants some breakfast.”</p>

<p>She reckoned right. Mrs. Hubble of the Horselunges
had refused to get breakfast for her lodger at such an
ungodly hour, and he had prowled round fasting to the
Beatups, eyeing their bacon and fried bread through the
window.</p>

<p>“The labourer is worthy of his hire,” he remarked as
he sat down to the table, “and thou shalt not muzzle the
ox which treadeth the corn....”</p>

<p>After breakfast they all went out to the Volunteer
field, which was to be cut first. Harry took charge of the
reaper, with Zacky a scowling protestant at the horse’s
head, while the others turned to the sickling and binding.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>

Mr. Poullett-Smith had not arrived, having first to read
Mattins and eat his breakfast, but he came about an hour
after the start, a tall, bending, monkish figure, feeling just
a little daring in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>The meeting of the two parsons was friendliest on
the Anglican side. Mr. Poullett-Smith was a good
example of the Church of England’s vocation “to provide
a resident gentleman for every parish”—besides,
he pitied Sumption. The fellow was so obviously misfitted
by his pastorate—a fanatical, ignorant Calvinism,
blown about by eschatological winds, was his whole
equipment; otherwise, thought the curate, he had neither
dignity, knowledge nor education. He would have been
far happier had he been left a blacksmith, had his half-crazy
visions been allowed to burn themselves out like his
forge fires, instead of being stoked by mistaken patronage
and inadequate theological training. As things stood, he
was absurd, even in no worthier setting than a forgotten
village Bethel—a mere caricature of a minister, even in
the pulpit of the Particular Baptists, an old-fashioned and
fanatical sect with their heads full of doomsday. But
here among the reapers he was splendid. His open shirt
displayed a neck strong and supple and plump as a boy’s—the
grey homespun was stuck with sweat to his shoulders,
and the huge muscles of his back showed under it
in long ovoid lumps. His years had taken nothing from
his strength, merely added to his solidness and endurance.
With his shock of brindled curls, his comely brown
skin, his teeth white as barley-kernels, and eyes bright and
deep as a hammer pond, and all the splendour of his body
from shoulder to heel, he was as fine a specimen of a
man as he was a poor specimen of a minister. Mr. Poullett-Smith
paid him the honour due to his body, while
seeing no honour due to his soul.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption felt his physical superiority to the willowy,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

tallow-faced curate; indeed he had a double advantage
over him, for he felt a spiritual towering too. He
despised his doctrines of Universal Redemption and
Sacramental Grace just as much as he despised his lean
white arms and delicate features. He gave his hand a
grip that made him wince—he could feel the bones cracking
under the pressure.... “He keeps his hands white
that he may hold the Lord’s body,” he thought to himself.</p>

<p>The day was hot and misty. The blue sky glowed
with a thick, soft heat, and a yellowish haze blurred
hedges and barns. Even the roofs of Worge seemed far
away, and the sounds of the neighbouring farms were
dim—but distant sounds came more clearly, a siren
crooned on the far-off sea, and the mutter of guns came
like a tread over the motionless air. Harry heard it as
he drove the reaper, mingling with the swish of sickles
and the rub of bones.</p>

<p>For greater quickness, he had split the field into two
unequal parts—the bigger one he was cutting with the
reaper, the smaller was being cut by hand. Mr. Sumption,
Mus’ Beatup and Elphick reaped, while Nell, the
curate, Juglery and the boy from Prospect Cottages
bound the sheaves. The old horse went so slowly that the
sickles worked nearly as fast as the machine. After a
time Harry gave up his place to his father, who had been
unfitted by illness and intemperance for much strenuous
work.</p>

<p>At first there was some talking and joking among the
harvesters, but soon this wore to silence in the heat.
Only from where Mr. Smith and Nell stooped together
over the reaped corn, gathering it into sheaves, came
murmurs of sound. Nell’s pale cheeks and lips were
flushed with her toil and stooping, and her eyes were
bright with a pleasure which toil cannot give. Her cotton
dress, the colour of the sky, set out the brightness of her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>

hair, the colour of the corn. Her graceful, ineffectual
hands, too, pleased the curate, for they were the only pair
besides his in the field which were not coarse and burnt,
with stubbed, black nails. Moreover, her pleasure and excitement
at the day’s long promise made her more
talkative than usual, and to a better purpose. He found
that he liked her pleasant, blurry voice, which fled and
fluttered over her words for fear that she should drawl
them.</p>

<p>The sun climbed to the zenith, and the heat not only
baked down from the sky, but scorched up out of the
ground. The dust of the earth and of corn-stalks filled
the air with a choking, chaffy thickness. The smell of
dust came from the road, and from farmyards the smell
of baking mud. The black oasts of Egypt across the way
swam in a cloud of heat, and the red oasts of Worge were
smeared to shadows in the steam of sunshine and dust.
An aching of blue and yellow was in the harvesters’ eyes,
and their bodies seemed to melt and drip. The reaper
crawled even more slowly, with Mus’ Beatup sagging
drowsily over the reins, and Zacky drooping against old
Tassell, whose flanks ran with sweat, and from whose
steaming hide came ammoniacal stable smells, whiffing
over the harvesters every time he passed.</p>

<p>Mr. Poullett-Smith looked more than ever like a
Sienese candle now that his forehead and cheeks were
dabbled with sweat, like wax that had melted and run.
He wiped his face periodically with a white handkerchief,
which annoyed Mr. Sumption, though it was a fact that
the curate had done excellent work, and made up in
conscientious energy what he lacked in muscle and
experience.</p>

<p>“Take off your waistcoat, or your sweat ull spoil the
lining,” called the minister, and Mr. Smith rather unexpectedly
followed his advice, having, as it happened,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>

quite lost sight of the pastor in that huge toiling figure,
now almost bare of chest, with arms swinging like a
flail. He saw only a labourer more experienced and a
man more manly than himself, whose muscle he respected
and whose commands he would obey.</p>

<p>From twelve o’clock onwards the problem for Harry
had been to keep Mus’ Beatup away from the Rifle
Volunteer. The field being near the Street, they could
hear the pleasing jar of stopping wheels, the slam of
the taproom door, even the creak of the Volunteer sign.
As he swung out there over the Street, with his grey-green
uniform and obsolete rifle, he seemed to say, “In
my day yeomen never worked at noon, but came and
drank good beer made of Sussex hops and talked of how
we’d beat the French.... Now there is no good beer,
and hardly any Sussex hops, and we talk of how we and
the French together will beat the Germans. But come,
good yeomen, all the same.”</p>

<p>Harry thought it advisable to detach Mus’ Beatup
from the reaper, which trundled him up under the eaves
of the Volunteer’s huge sprawling roof, so he suggested
that old Juglery should take his place for a while, and
that Mus’ Beatup should help with the binding. He also
persuaded Mr. Sumption to give up his sickle and bind
till closing-time. He felt that if his father worked between
the two parsons he would not be so likely to scuffle
an escape; for in spite of his rationalist enlightenment,
Mus’ Beatup’s attitude in the presence of the clergy was
very different from that which he took up in their absence—and
his contempt of their doctrine was liable to
be swallowed up in respect for their cloth.</p>

<p>Dinner was brought out soon after noon by Mrs.
Beatup and the girl, a hard-breathing young person with
a complexion like an over-ripe plum. There was beer,
and there was tea, and bread and cheese—Mrs. Beatup’s

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>

idea of summat gentlemanly to put inside the clergyman
materialised in several crumbly sandwiches of tinned curried
rabbit. They all sat down under the hedge furthest
from the Volunteer, and were all rather silent, except
Mr. Sumption, who had scarcely tired himself with the
morning’s work and thought this a good opportunity to
enter into an argument, or “hold a conference,” as he
put it, with Mr. Poullett-Smith on the doctrine of Efficacious
Grace. Mr. Smith, besides the reluctance of his
Anglican breeding to discuss theology with an outsider,
and his feeling as a public-school man that it was bad
form to talk shop in mixed company, was far from theologically
minded. Though he would not have owned it
for worlds, he was already tired out. The continual
stooping with the hot sun on his back had made him feel
sick and dizzy, and Mrs. Beatup’s curried sandwiches had
finished the work of the sun and roused definite symptoms
of an indelicate nature. He lay against the hedge, looking
languid and curiously human in his open shirt, his hair
hanging a little over his forehead. Nell sat on her heels,
and her eyes played over him tenderly, almost maternally.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re tired,” she said in a low, drawling
voice that no one else could hear.</p>

<p>They did not go back to work till nearly two, and the
danger for Mus’ Beatup was over for the time. The
afternoon was, as usual, more tiring than the morning,
for the earth, if not the sun, was hotter, limbs were tired
and stomachs were full. Harry mounted the curate on
the reaper, though he was not much of a success, as he
failed to realise the power of old Tassell’s habit, and did
vigorous rein-work at the corners, with the result that the
old horse was thrown completely off his bearings, and on
one occasion nearly charged down the hedge, on another
knocked over Zacky, and once came wearily to a standstill
with all four feet in the uncut corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Poullett-Smith decided that he preferred binding
to reaping, and was glad to find himself back beside
Nell with her delicate ways—it was wonderful, he
thought, how far she was above her surroundings; he
had not noticed it before, for he had hardly ever seen
her against the background of Worge, but in the frame
of church or school, where her shining was not so bright.
She was tired, he could see, but she did not grow moist
and blowsy like the rest—her pretty hair draggled a bit,
her mouth drooped rather sweetly, but exertion heightened
her anæmic tints, and there was a glow about her
when she talked, in spite of her fatigue.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the afternoon, she broke
away from him, and came back with a glass of water.</p>

<p>“Is that for me?” he exclaimed, as she held it out.</p>

<p>“Yes. I thought you must be getting thirsty.”</p>

<p>“I am—but aren’t you thirsty, too?”</p>

<p>“I had something to drink in the house—this is yours,”
and she watched him drink with an eager sweetness and
humility in her eyes.</p>

<h3>14</h3>

<p>For the next two or three days the work went well.
The Volunteer Field was reaped, and then the Street
Field; the Sunk and Forges must be tackled before the
fine weather came to an end, but the low grounds by
Bucksteep might be left to stand a little, being sheltered,
and not quite ready for harvest. Harry’s mixed gang of
helpers was a bigger success than he had dared hope.
Mr. Sumption was even better the second day than the
first, having worked down a stiffness which his big
muscles had acquired from long disuse. Even Mrs.
Beatup was impressed, and gave him a fine breakfast
every morning. The other clergyman was not so useful,
but he made up in effort what he lacked in achievement,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>

and by Friday was doing quite a creditable day’s work.
Nell was not, of course, much good, still, she was better
than nothing, and more energetic and good-humoured
than Harry had ever seen her. Zacky and the hired boy
conspired in laziness and evil-doing, and Harry was
grateful when the Rev. Mr. Sumption took it upon himself
to knock their heads together.</p>

<p>On Friday evening grey smears of cloud lay on a
strange whiteness in the west, and on Saturday the whole
sky was smudged over with a pale opacity, and the wind
blew from the South. The labourers found relief from
the stewing, chaffy stillness of the last few days; but
Harry snuffed the air and looked wise.</p>

<p>“The weather’s breaking up,” he said to his father
in the dinner-hour. “We’ll have to work on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Wud two passons!” cried Mus’ Beatup. “They’ll
never coame. They’ll be preaching tales about dead
men.”</p>

<p>“Reckon we must do wudout them. We durn’t leave
the Sunk Field till after the weather. Bucksteep can
wait, surelye, but the Sunk must be reaped before the
rain.”</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup groaned—“That’s the wust of doing
aught wud passons. ’Tis naun to them if it rains on
Monday—all they care is that a dunnamany hunderd
years agone it rained forty days and forty nights and
drownded all the world saave Noah and his beasts.
Bah!” and Mus’ Beatup spat into the hedge.</p>

<p>However, to their surprise, they found both the parsons
ready to work on Sunday. Mr. Poullett-Smith had no
less authority than the Archbishop of Canterbury—the
Archbishop quoted Christ’s saying of the ox in the pit,
and gave like indulgence to all Churchmen. The Rev.
Mr. Sumption appeared with no such sanctions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve got no Randall Cantuar or Charles John Chichester
to tell me I may break the Lord’s commandments.
Reckon the Assembly ull be against me in this, and the
Lord Himself ull be against me; but I’ll risk it. For
you’re a good lad, Harry Beatup, and I’m going to stand
by you, and if the Lord visits it on me I must bow to
His will.”</p>

<p>When service-time came he had the advantage, for he
polished off his bewildered congregation in only a little
over half an hour, whereas the curate was nearly two
hours at Brownbread Street, with a sung Eucharist. “I
can say what I like and pray what I like,” said Mr.
Sumption. “I’m not tied down to a Roman Mass-book
dressed-up Protestant.”</p>

<p>Mr. Smith heard him in silence. His respect for him
as a man and a labourer still outweighed his contempt
for him as preacher and theologian. Also he now felt
that in matters of religion Mr. Sumption was slightly
crazed. He could handle a horse or a hammer or a
sickle with sureness and skill, and talk of them with
sanity and knowledge, but once let him mount his
religious notions and he would ride to the devil. Mr.
Smith came to the conclusion that he was one of those
crack-brained people who believed that the war was the
end of the world, the Consummation of the Age foretold
in Scripture, and that soon Christ would come again in the
clouds with great glory.—This really was what Mr. Sumption
believed, so Mr. Smith did not misjudge him much.</p>

<p>By noon on Sunday dark clouds were swagging up
from the south-west, with a screaming wind before them.
The fog and dust of the last few days had been followed
by an unnatural clearness—each copse and fields and pond
and lane in the country of the Four Roads stood sharply
out, with inky tones in its colouring. The fields sweeping
down from Sunday Street to Horse Eye were shaded
from indigo almost to black, and on the marsh the slatting

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

water-courses gleamed like steel on the heavy teal-green
of their levels. The sea was drawn in a black line
against a thick, unhealthy white sky, blotched and
straggled with grey.</p>

<p>“It’ll rain before dusk,” said Harry. “It can’t hoald
out much longer.”</p>

<p>“We’ll never git the field shocked, let alone brought
in,” said Mus’ Beatup. “Here we’ve bin five hour and
not maade more’n a beginning—it’s lamentaable. Reckon
we might as well let the Germans beat us—we cudn’t have
wuss weather.”</p>

<p>Harry set his teeth.</p>

<p>“We’ll git it finished afore the rain.”</p>

<p>“Afore your grandmother dies,” jeered Mus’ Beatup.
“I’m off to the Volunteer.”</p>

<p>“And leave us.... Faather!”</p>

<p>“I’m not a-going to stay here catching my death wud
rheumatics, working in the rain under my son’s orders.
Reckon you’d sooner see me dead than lose your hemmed
oats—my hemmed oats I shud say—but I—” and Mus’
Beatup swung up his chin haughtily—“have different
feelings.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you have, and you ought to be ashaumed
of yourself!” cried Harry thickly, then flushed in self
rebuke, for on the whole he was a respectful son.</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup sauntered away, his hands in his pockets,
his shoulders hunched to his ears—his usual attitude
when he felt guilty but wanted to look swaggering. Mr.
Sumption and Mr. Poullett-Smith were both at the
further end of the field, and no opposition stood between
him and the Rifle Volunteer save the doubtful quality
his wife might offer from the kitchen window. Harry
watched him with burning cheeks and a full throat.
“Reckon I’m lik to kip temperance all my days wud
this,” he mumbled bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>He then went down to the other workers, and told
them that it was going to rain and that they were a
labourer short, as his father was feeling ill and had gone
indoors to rest, but that he hoped by “tar’ble hard wark”
to get the field cut before the storm. “If the grain’s
shocked, it’ll bear the rain, but if it’s left standing, the
rain ull beat down the straw, and all the seed ull fly.
Juglery, you taake the reaper—Norry Noakes, you git to
Tassell’s head—Mus’ Sumption and Elphick and I ull
reap, and Mus’ Smith and Nell and Zacky bind....
Now I reckon ’tis a fight ’twixt us and them gurt clouds
over Galleybird.”</p>

<p>Elphick and Juglery were inclined to grumble at having
their dinner-hour cut short, and talked of judgments
equally bestowed on “them wot bruk the Sabbath” and
“them wot bruk up grass.” But Mus’ Sumption’s professional
opinion was that the approaching storm was not
in the nature of a punitive expedition—“If the Lord had
wanted to spoil this harvest, He would have done it on
Thursday or Friday; now all He’ll get is the tail-end,
and not that if I can help it.”</p>

<p>He bent his huge back to the sickle, and worked for
the next hour without straightening. Mr. Poullett-Smith
decided to forget the Sunday-school he was supposed to
catechise at three, and Nell to forget the headache which
would probably have sent her off the field at the same
hour. Norry Noakes and Zacky, seeing their deliverance
nigh, put more energy into that afternoon than they had
put into all four other days of harvest—Norry nearly
dragged Tassell’s head off his neck in his efforts to make
him go faster.</p>

<p>At about three o’clock, Mr. Sumption stood up and
scanned the fields under his hand like Elijah’s servant
watching for rain. Then he gave a shout that made
everyone start and straighten their backs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lo! the Lord is on our side—behold more labourers
for the harvest.”</p>

<p>Two figures were coming down the field from Worge—Ivy
Beatup and a soldier. Ivy wore a pink cotton dress,
belling out all round her with the wind and flapping
against the soldier’s legs. She also carried unexpectedly
a pink parasol.</p>

<p>“Thought I’d come over and see you all!” she bawled
as soon as she was within earshot. “This is Sergeant
Eric Staples from Canada.”</p>

<p>... Canada! Then no doubt he knew a bit about
harvesting. Harry went forward to meet them.</p>

<p>“Mother toald us you’d half the Sunk to reap before
the weather,” said Ivy, at closer range, “so I said we’d
come and give you a hand, surelye.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be unaccountable glad to have you both—the
rain’s blowing up and we’re short of workers.”</p>

<p>“I’m on it, as the boys say, and so’s the Sergeant, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Sergeant Staples, staring round him.</p>

<p>“Mother’s gitting a valiant supper fur us when ’tis all
a-done. She says if you’ve bruk the Sabbath one way
you may as well break it another and maake a good job
of it. Thyrza’s coming, and is bringing all her tinned
salmon. Wot do you think of my sunshade, Nell?—reckon
it’s unaccountable smart,” and Ivy threw it down
into the stubble and began rolling up her sleeves.</p>

<p>“It’s middling kind of you,” said Harry politely to
Sergeant Staples.</p>

<p>“Only too glad—I’ve done a power of this work over
in Sask. May I ask what this little buggy is?”—and
he pointed to the nodding erection of old Juglery
chaired above the reins that slacked on Tassell’s
rump.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the reaper, surelye.”</p>

<p>The Canadian did not speak, but the puzzled look
deepened on his face.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’ll taake a sickle, being handy-like?”</p>

<p>“Sure”—but when Harry gave him Mus’ Beatup’s
discarded weapon he held it at arm’s length and scratched
his head. Then he slid up to Ivy—</p>

<p>“Say, kid, I never heard before as in the old country
they cut corn with a pocket-knife.”</p>

<p>However, he swung his tool handily, and with the two
new workers, and the extra energy of the old, the reaping
went forward at a pace which threatened the victory of
those black clouds over Galleybird.</p>

<p>The wind blew in droning gusts, swishing in the corn,
and fiddling in the boughs of Forges Wood. Dead leaves
began to fly out of the wood, the threat of autumn. The
men’s shirts blew against their skins, and the women’s
skirts flew out; the colours of the field grew dim—the
corn was white, the wood and the hedges were grey—only
the clothes of the harvesters stood out in smudges
of pink and blue. Then suddenly rain began to squirt
down out of a black smeary sky like charcoal—the wind
screamed, almost flattening the few last rods. No one
spoke, for no voice could be heard above the howling of
the wind. Rabbits began to pop out of the corn, but there
were no hunting dogs, no shouting groups from the cottages
come out to see the fun. When the last sickleful
had been cut, and the reaper stood still, with old Juglery
asleep on the seat, the harvesters picked up their coats
and pulled down their sleeves without a word.</p>

<p>They were wet through—the muscles of the men’s
bodies showed through their clinging shirts and the
women were wringing their gowns. But the Sunk Field
was reaped and Harry’s harvest saved. He had won his
battle against his own ignorance, his father’s indifference,
and the earth’s treacheries. He had vindicated his daring,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>

and he would never know how small was the thing he
had done—a few scrubby acres sown and reaped, a few
mean quarters of indifferent grain gathered in—he would
never hear Sergeant Staples say to Sergeant Speed of the
North-West Provinces that he had spent a slack afternoon
cutting mustard and cress with a pocket-knife.</p>

<p>Food was waiting up at the farm, with Thyrza Beatup,
who, for obvious reasons now, had been unable to help
with the harvest, but had done her best by contributing
her entire stock of tinned salmon to the harvest-supper.
The party began to move off, Mr. Poullett-Smith wrapping
his coat over Nell’s shoulders with hands that perhaps
strayed a little to touch her neck. Only Mr. Sumption
was left, standing upright and stockish on the rise of
the field, a huge black shape against the sky.</p>

<p>“Come along, Mus’ Sumption,” called Ivy, “and git
a nice tea-supper. Thur’s tinned salmon and a caake.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption’s voice came to them on the scream of
the wind—</p>

<p>“Shall I go without thanking the Lord of the Harvest
for His mercies in allowing us to gather in the fruits of
the earth on the Sabbath Day?”</p>

<p>“He’s praying,” said Nell, with a shiver of disgust in
her voice.</p>

<p>The curate bit his lip.</p>

<p>“He’s perfectly right,” he said, and going up to the
minister, he knelt down in the stubble. The others huddled
in a sheepish group by the gate. Mr. Sumption’s
prayer was blown over their heads, washed into the woods
on the rain, but they could hear the groan of his big
voice in the wind, and here and there a word of his
familiar prayer-vocabulary.... “Lord ... day ...
oven ... wicked ... righteous ... Satan ... save
... forgive.... Amen.”</p>

<h2>PART V: NELL</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">AUTUMN came, and gradually the farm-work slackened.
The Bucksteep acres were cut, not much the
worse for the storm—the hops were picked, and
showed a fair crop of fuggles, though the goldings had
not done so well. Harry sowed catch crops of trifolium
and Italian rye grass, and started his autumn ploughings.
Certain reactions had seized him after the harvest, and
he had gone off wandering in the fields, away to villages
where he had not strayed for months except to market.
But the lapse had been short, for the adventure of
Worge’s acres was not dead—his imagination had now
its headquarters and sanctuary in the fields where he
worked; he had no need to seek dreams and beauty far
away, for they grew at his barndoor, and he strawed
them in the furrows with his grain.</p>

<p>Tom’s dwindling zeal was reawakened by the account
of the harvest which Harry scrawled to France—“Nine
quarters we got from the Volunteer Field and five from
the Sunk and six from Forges. Hops and roots did
middling. All the potash fields were valiant. Maybe
next year Father will buy a reaper-and-binder. The
Reverend Mr. Sumption was proper at the harvest.”
His brother wrote back a letter of which “Well done,
young ’un” was the refrain. “Queer,” he wrote, “but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>

there’s a Forges Wood out here—they say the 5th Sussex
named it and it was called something French before. It
is not like Forges, for it is narrow like a dibble and the
trees have no branches, being knocked off by crumps and
nothing grows there becos of the gas. There are dead
horses in it.”</p>

<p>Tom had seen plenty of fighting that autumn in
Paschendaele, but was so far well and unhurt. He sent
Thyrza home a bit of shell which had knocked off his tin
hat and “shocked him all of a swum.” Everyone, he
wrote, had laughed fit to bust at it—Thyrza thought
that they laughed at queer things in the trenches. She
fretted a little during those autumn days, for her hope
was now almost a torment ... suppose Tom should
never see the child their love had made. Every day in
the paper there were long casualty lists, every day telegraph
boys and girls went peddling to happy homes and
blasted them with a slip of paper. They had knocked
at doors in the country of the Four Roads—the eldest
Pix had been killed early in October; then there had
been the butcher’s son at Bodle Street, and the lawyer’s
son at Hailsham, and poor Mus’ Piper’s boy had lost
both legs.... The world looked suddenly very grey
and treacherous to Thyrza; she dared not hope, lest
hope should betray her, and her few moments of peaceful
mother-happiness were riddled with doubts. Oh, if only
God would let her have Tom back somehow, no matter
how maimed, how helpless, how dependent on her....
Then she would suddenly react from her desire, shrink
back in horror at the thought of Tom wounded, his
strong sweet body all sick and disfigured.... “Better
dead,” she would groan—and yet, a dead father for her
child.... She found war a very tar’ble thing.</p>

<p>During the earlier years she had, in company with
most people in the country of the Four Roads, passed
lightly under its yoke. Even her widowhood had not
brought it down upon her—Sam had so often left her,
might so easily have come to grief in other ways. Except
for those who were actually and poignantly bereaved,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>

the War made little difference to a large multitude for
whom it existed only in France and in the newspapers.
For a big section of England it did not begin till 1916,
for it was not till then that it actually set foot on English
soil. In 1916 the Conscription Act, the food scarcity,
and War Agricultural Committees dumped it down on
the doorsteps of Sussex folk who up till then had ignored
it as a furrin business. Thyrza had not thought about
it much—she had read the newspapers, and given little
bits of help to war charities that appealed to her; but
now that it had taken the man she loved, it had taken
her too. She was tied with him to its chariot-wheels,
one of the nameless victims of the great woe.</p>

<p>Her business, too, fretted her. She was not able for
the exertions of the times, and was worried by the difficulties
of getting supplies. To have no sweets for the
little children who came in with their pennies, no tea for
the old men and women who wanted it to warm and
cheer their poor rheumatic bodies, no cheese and no
bacon for the young men who worked in the fields ...
all this grieved her gentle heart, and she brooded over it
in a way she would not have done had she been in her
usual health. She grew pale and nervous, found she had
but little to say to lingering customers, sat huddled limply
over her fire, rising slowly and heavily when the buzz
of the little bell that used to be so gay forced her to exert
herself and go to the door.</p>

<p>In this state, Mrs. Beatup took pity on her, and forgot
the tacit warfare of the mother on the wife. If Thyrza
was going to give a child to Tom, she was also going to
give a grandchild to Tom’s mother. She often waddled
down to the shop with good advice, or asked Thyrza up
for an evening at Worge, and developed a new and unexpected
optimism for her comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reckon if Tom’s alive he’ll stick alive to the end—if
he’d bin going to be killed he’d have bin killed afore
now. Besides, he always wur the chap fur luck. I
remember how when he wur a liddle feller he slid into
the pond, and we all thought he’d be drownded, but Juglery
pulled him out, and his faather hided him nigh out
of his skin. So doan’t you vrother, my dear, but kip in
good heart fur the saake of the liddle ’un wot’s coming.
Tom ull live to see un, I can promise you. He sims unaccountable
young to have a baby, but reckon he’d be
younger still to die.”</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>If that autumn was cruel to Thyrza in its torture of
waxing hope it was crueller still to Nell in its torture of
hope’s dying. For a week after the harvest she had
lived in flowery fields of memory, pied with all bright
colours. When she shut her eyes she could see his face
bending close to hers over the shocked corn, his thin
delicate hands moving among the straw, sliding close
enough to hers for an accidental touch ... she could
feel them brush her neck as he helped her into his coat
at the day’s end of prayer and storm....</p>

<p>For a week her heart drowsed in its own sweetness.
Nell was happy, she grew gentler and kinder. She was
no longer an ineffective little rebel, full of disgusts and
grumbles—a delicious languor was upon her, a bright
dimness which veiled all the jags and uglinesses of her
life. During this week she did not see Mr. Poullett-Smith,
but her mind rested sweetly in his memory.
Perhaps the physical fatigue of the harvest, mixed with
the natural inertia of her anæmic condition, both had a
share in bringing about a certain passivity, or perhaps
it was the change of her love from scourge to comfort
which put an end to all her old restless efforts to see him,
her making of opportunities, her fretting glances from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>

the schoolhouse window, her nervous strayings to church.
Anyhow she did not see him till Sunday, when her
glorious castle fell.</p>

<p>He came into Sunday-school as usual, with a benedictory
smile. Her memories of him in his open shirt, with
his face all red and shining and his hair caked with sweat
on his forehead, made her feel a little shocked to see him
again in his long black cassock, above which his face
showed waxy and white. Perhaps a touch of sunburn
lingered, but the black of his priestly garment wiped it
out. Who would have thought, said Nell to herself, that
this day a week ago he had been toiling as a farmhand,
with bare arms and throat, all baked and burnt and dirty
and sweaty...?</p>

<p>He greeted the superintendent, and talked for a few
moments at her desk; then he came down among the
teachers and their classes. Nell wore a white blouse and
a big white hat like an ox-eyed daisy. Her book slid
from her knee to the floor, and there was a scuffle among
her children as Freddie Gurr from Hazard’s Green
dropped the worm he had been nursing for comfort
through the chills of his mediæval Sunday; but she did
not hear as she half rose for her greeting, then sank back,
as in the level, indifferent tones in which he had said
“Good morning, Miss Sinden—good morning, Miss Pix,”
he said “Good morning, Miss Beatup,” and passed on to
“Good morning, Miss Viner.”</p>

<p>Nell’s heart constricted with pain. She told herself
that she was a fool to be so sensitive, that it was not
likely Mr. Poullett-Smith would greet her publicly in the
manner of their harvest friendship. But she could get
no comfort from her self-rebuke, for deep in herself she
knew that she was wise. Doubtless there was no importance
to be attached to the coldness of her friend’s
greeting. Nevertheless, he had that morning, silently

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

and symbolically, declared the gulf between them. In
the cornfield, working as her comrade, he had stood for
a short while on her level—for the first time her efforts
to attract him had been without handicap. But now the
handicap was restored—he was the Priest-in-Charge of
Brownbread Street, and she was the daughter of a
drunken farmer. If for a few hours she had charmed
him out of his eminent sense of fitness, the charm was
over now. What had this dignified, cassocked ecclesiastic
to do with her, a poor little nobody? His friendliness
during their common toil had been a mere passing
emotion; probably she had exaggerated it—even the little
her memory held must be halved, and that poor remainder
cancelled out by the probability that he had forgotten it.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the curate had not forgotten it, but
the attraction had not been robust enough to survive the
loss of its surroundings. He saw that he had been unwise
and rather unkind in yielding so easily to a mere
temporary prepossession. His more solid affections had
long been engaged elsewhere, and he spent some hours
of real self-reproach for having ever so briefly faltered.
He might have put ideas into the girl’s head—they had
certainly been in his own. However, he reflected, there
was not time to have done much harm, and he would set
matters straight at once. So for the next month his behaviour
to Nell was unflaggingly cold and polite, and at
the end of it all the parish was told of his engagement
to Marian Lamb.</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>There were days of desolation for Nell Beatup that
November. Her disappointment gripped her as a black
frost grips the fields; she felt powerless, bound, and
sterile. Even the last month, when bit by bit her happy
memories were destroyed, when she learned that all her

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>

hopes were built on an exaggeration, a mistake, even that
month of slow disillusion had been better than this black
month of despair. In October a few crumpled leaves had
reddened the trees, a few pale draggled flowers had sweetened
the garden, a bird had sometimes perched on the
gable end and sung before he flew away. But now the
fields were black and the woods were dun, the lanes were
a poach of mud, and the smell of mud hung above field-gates
and barns—a clammy mist rose from the ponds,
making the air substantial with the taste of water ...
tears ... they seemed to hang in the rainy clouds, to
dribble from the trodden earth, and, mixed with the dead
summer’s dust, they made a grey slimy mud that sobbed
and sucked under her feet on her daily trudge to school.</p>

<p>The killing of her hope was no mercy. Even that sick
thing had been better than this emptiness, this death.
Hope had sustained her for years, for years she had had
nothing more robust to feed on than her pale infatuation
for a man who seldom gave her crumbs. She had become
skilled in hoping, long practice made her an experienced
artificer of hope, able to build a palace out of a few
broken bricks. She had never known any other love
than this ghost of one, so there had never been a chance
of its dying of comparison. She had no intimate girl
friends, and Ivy’s full-blooded affairs struck her only
with the grossness of their quality, giving her own by
contrast a refinement and poetry that made it doubly
precious.</p>

<p>Then had come the wonderland of those harvest days,
when hope had almost passed into confidence, when all
the wonderful things of love she had never learned yet—glamour,
pride, perfection, satisfaction—had shown her
their burning shapes. But it had all been false, a mirage
of that same hope’s sick intensity, an overreaching of
the artificer’s skill; and now her tears had turned to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

mud the golden dust of harvest, and all her dreams were
dead—and stuck to her still, clogging and fouling, like
this mud of Slivericks Lane on her boots.</p>

<p>Luckily, her day-long absence made it possible for her
to hide her wretchedness from her family. At school her
listlessness was commented on—a listlessness alternating
with an increased nerviness and a tendency to cry when
found fault with—but as Nell had always been a little
languid and a little hysterical, these exaggerations of her
natural state were put down to her health, and the schoolmistress
persuaded her to take a patent medicine containing
iron. Her love affair had been conducted on
such delicate lines that only a few had noticed it, and
no one except Ivy had given it any importance. Ivy was
intensely sorry for her sister, and on one Sunday’s visit
dared to probe her state. But Nell was like a poor little
cat caught by the tail, and could only scratch and spit,
so Ivy good-naturedly gave up the effort. She was quite
her old self again, judging by the “pals” she brought
over to Worge on her Sundays off—Motorman Hodder
and Motorman Davis, and Sergeant Staples, and Private
La Haye, and Corporal Bunch of the Moose Jaws, and
other Canadians quartered at Hastings, who sat in the
kitchen, saying, “Sure” and “Yep” and “Nope.”</p>

<p>“Reckon it’s kill or cure wud you,” said Mrs. Beatup,
and no one knew precisely what she meant.</p>

<p>Nell thought her worst moment would be when she delivered
to Mr. Poullett-Smith the pretty little speech she
had been making up ever since she heard of his engagement.
It was fairly bad, for Marian Lamb was with him
and had already assumed a galliard air of proprietorship.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, Miss Beatup—it’s awfully kind
of you. Yes, I’m awfully happy, and”—coyly—“I hope

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>

Harry is too. But we mustn’t stop any more—Harry has
still the remains of his cold. <em>Do</em> turn up your collar, you
naughty boy.”</p>

<p>Nell walked away rigid with contempt. “She’s silly
and she’s vulgar—she’s vulgarer than I, for all I’m only a
farmer’s daughter. ‘Naughty boy!’—how common!
She’s worse than Ivy.”</p>

<p>Miss Marian gave up her Red Cross work, and was
seen going for long walks with her Harry, and accompanying
him on his parish rounds. She was a big, ungainly,
soapily clean female, with a certain uncouth girlishness
which did not endear her to the curate’s flock.
Nell could not imagine what he “saw in her”—she certainly
did not read the <cite>Sermons of St. Gregory</cite>. She
wondered if he had loved her long—the parish said
“years,” but that he had been unable to propose (1) till
an expected legacy arrived, (2) till Miss Marian was sure
she could get nobody else. At all events, he must have
been in love with her during those days of Nell’s mirage—it
was another bitter realisation for her to swallow, another
choking mouthful of humble-pie.</p>

<p>The poor little teacher crept about forlornly. She had
not officially given up her Sunday-school class, but she
seized flimsy pretexts to keep away; she even sometimes
stayed away from church—then would force herself to
go thrice of a Sunday, in case her absence should be put
down to its true cause. She dodged the curate and
Marian in the lanes, but she seemed to run into them at
every corner—they always seemed to be going by the
schoolhouse window. One evening, as she passed Mr.
Smith’s cottage by the church, she saw the firelight leaping
in his uncurtained study, and two dark figures stooping
together against the glow. She stopped and stared in,
like a beggar watching a feast; the table was laid for tea,
and there were his books and his pictures, all ruddy in
the firelight, the flickering, shuttled walls of the little
room in which she had never set foot—his home. Marian
was there; she would pour out his tea and hand him his
cup. She would say, “Eat some more, dear; you’ve had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>

a tiring day.” Then she would make him lie back in his
armchair and put his feet to the fire, and she would curl
up at his feet and read him the <cite>Sermons of St. Gregory</cite>....
No, she wouldn’t do anything like this. Nell
laughed—that woman was Nell, not Marian. She was
putting herself where she wanted to be, in the other’s
place. Marian would say, “Don’t eat all the cake,
naughty boy.” And then she would go and sit on his
knee. Ugh!... And Nell, who would have done so
differently, stood outside in the November dusk, with
tears and rain on her face, and little cold, red hands
clenched in impotent longing.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>At the end of November the bells rang for the advance
at Cambrai—old Dallington tower rocked with its chimes,
and even the little tin clapper at Brownbread Street
tinkled away for an hour or more. Mr. Poullett-Smith
and his organist spent half a dozen evenings trying to
make a dodging choir face a Solemn Te Deum approved
by the Gregorian Society. Unluckily, the singers who
would have easily blustered through Stainer in F or
Martin in C, grew hang-dog and discouraged in the knots
of Tones and Mediations, so that by the time the Te
Deum was ready, Bourlon Wood had been evacuated by
the British and the victory of Cambrai became something
perilously near a fiasco. Fortunately the capture of Jerusalem
soon afterwards saved the Te Deum from being
wasted.</p>

<p>These alternating victories and disasters were very bad
for Mus’ Beatup, for he celebrated them all in the same
way at the Rifle Volunteer. The only difference was that
from some obscure sport of habit he celebrated a victory
in gin and a defeat in whisky. He was very bad after
both aspects of Cambrai, and Jerusalem brought him to
ruin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after nine there was a loud knocking at the back
door, rousing all the Beatups who had fallen asleep in the
kitchen. Nell was asleep because she always seemed to
be tired and drowsy now, Mrs. Beatup was asleep because
she reckoned she wouldn’t have much of a night
with Maaster, Zacky and Harry were asleep on the floor
in front of the fire, curled up together like puppies—Zacky
because it was long past the time he ought to have
been in bed, Harry because he had had a hard day
ploughing the clays. There was great confusion and
rubbing of eyes, and the knock was repeated.</p>

<p>“Go and see who it is, Nell,” said Mrs. Beatup.
“Harry, I dreamt as we wur being bombed by Zepperlians
like the folk at Pett.”</p>

<p>“I dreamt of naun—I’m going to sleep agaun.”</p>

<p>He dropped his head back against Zacky—and just
at that moment Nell reappeared in the doorway, with a
terrified face.</p>

<p>“Mother—it’s father; he’s been hurt....”</p>

<p>“Hurt!—you mean killed....”</p>

<p>“I don’t—I mean hurt. There’s a man with him,
helping him in.”</p>

<p>“I’m a-going,” and Mrs. Beatup seized the lamp and
waddled out, followed by her scared and sleepy offspring.</p>

<p>In the passage a big soldier was propping up a Mus’
Beatup who looked as if he was stuffed with sawdust.</p>

<p>“He’s had a bit of a fall,” said the soldier as he
staggered under his burden. “I was seeing him home
like, and he slipped in the yard.”</p>

<p>“I reckon every boan in his body’s bruk,” said Mrs.
Beatup—“that’s how he looks, surelye. Let him sit
down, poor soul.”</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup slid through the soldier’s arms to a sitting
posture on the floor. Harry pushed forward and offered
to help carry him into the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Someone ud better go fur a doctor,” said the escort.
“I don’t like the look of him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup held the lamp to her husband’s face, and
Harry at the same time recognised the soldier as the
eldest Kadwell from Stilliands Tower—not he who had
loved and ridden away from Jen Hollowbone, but another
brother in the Engineers. Mus’ Beatup’s eyes were
open and dazed, his mouth was open and dribbling, and
his limbs were dangling forlornly. When they tried
to pick him up, they found that his right leg was
broken.</p>

<p>“Zacky—run up to Dallington and fetch Dr. Styles
this wunst,” ordered Harry. “Tell him it’s a broken leg—he’ll
have to bring summat to mend it with.”</p>

<p>Zacky ran off agog, and Nell, who had been through
a first-aid course in the early days of her rivalry with
Marian Lamb, forced herself to swallow her repulsion
of the drunken, stricken figure on the passage floor, and
come forward with advice.</p>

<p>“He ought to be put to bed at once ... he might
collapse.”</p>

<p>“He’s collapsed,” said Mrs. Beatup in the indifferent
voice of shock.</p>

<p>“But he must be kept warm—I’ll heat a brick in the
oven. Harry, you and Mr.——”</p>

<p>“—Kadwell,” put in the soldier, with a bold look into
Nell’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Kadwell—please carry him up to bed. Can you
manage him up the stairs?”</p>

<p>“Reckon we’ll have to,” said Harry. “Stand clear,
mother.... Got his shoulders, Mus’ Kadwell?—I’ll
taake his legs.”</p>

<p>They had a dead weight to carry to the upper floor,
but Harry, though short, was a strong, stuggy little chap,
and Steve Kadwell was enormous. He stood four inches

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>

over six foot and was proportionately hullish of girth.
He was a handsome man, too—as he passed Nell, she
noticed his brawny neck and great rolling quiff of fair,
curly hair; she also noticed that he looked at her in a
way no other man had done. The lamplight fell becomingly
on her pretty scared face, and suggested with soft
orange lights and melting shadows the curves of her little
breast. At first she was pleased by his frank admiration,
then something in it made her feel ashamed, and she
drew back angrily into the shadow.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>Nell had to stop away from school till the end of the
term, for Mrs. Beatup could not possibly nurse her husband
without help; indeed, Nell’s help was often not
enough. A broken leg in itself was serious damage for
a man of Mus’ Beatup’s age and habits, and into the
bargain his alcoholic deprivations brought on an attack
of delirium tremens about the fifth day of his illness.
For this both Nell and her mother were inadequate—Nell
was sickened and terrified by this horrible travesty
of a human being that shook the springs in her father’s
bed, and Mrs. Beatup made him worse by trying to argue
with him and taking as a personal affront his assertions
as to the maggoty condition of the pillows. Harry had to
spend two days away from the fields in the combined
office of nurse and policeman, and on one occasion when
even his strength was not enough to keep Mus’ Beatup in
bed, Kadwell of Stilliands Tower prolonged an evening’s
call of enquiry till the next morning.</p>

<p>Young Kadwell often called to enquire, and made himself
useful in various ways. He was on a fortnight’s sick-leave,
after an outbreak of his old wound. He had
been sniped during some patrol work at Loos in 1915,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>

and though once more fit for service had been kept in
England ever since. At present he was quartered at
Eastbourne, but expected soon to be sent back to
France.</p>

<p>At first Nell was too harassed and miserable to realise
that his visits were largely on her account. Moreover,
she was sexually very humble—she had loved so long
without return that she had never learned to look for
advances. But Kadwell had no reason to hide his feelings,
nor any skill if he had had reason, so in time Nell
was bound to become aware of them. The discovery did
not give her any great pleasure—the faint pride she occasionally
felt at his notice was always dangerously on
the edge of disgust. She was sensitive throughout her
being to his coarseness—which at the same time had
curious, intermittent powers of attraction—and there was
something in his bold, appraising look which struck her
with shame; with his tastes, thoughts and appetites she
had nothing in common. She avoided him as much as
she could, feeling guilty because of the faint thrills which
occasionally mixed with her dislike.</p>

<p>It was a sad year’s ending. Her confinement in the
house dragged down even further her health and spirits,
her father’s sick-bed filled her with wretchedness and
shame. It seemed to preach to her the lesson of what
she really was, in spite of all her dreams. How had
she ever dared to plot for the greatness of the curate’s
love? Who was she to mate with a priest, a scholar,
a gentleman? The sordid grind of her day, shut up
in the muddle of Worge, her hours in that sag-roofed,
stuffy bedroom, nursing her father through the trivialities
and degradations of an illness brought on and intensified
by drink—and then the crowning irony of an
occasional “parish visit” from her loved one, his polite
enquiries, his parsonic sympathy—all seemed to shout at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>

her that she was nothing but a common girl, not only of
humble but of shameful heritage, an obscure, half-educated
nobody, who was now bearing the punishment of
her presumptuous hopes.</p>

<p>She gave up her Sunday-school class, making her
father’s illness an excuse; she also gave up going to
church. This was partly due to lack of time, partly to
a dread of the empty shell. She told herself bitterly
that her religion had never been real—it had only been
part of the mirage—she might as well give up the pretence
of it. Besides, she could not bear to look any more
on the background of her vanished dreams, the soft
colours and lights against which they had glowed, to hear
the sighing tones which had set them to music in her heart.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, when she had gone out to stretch
her cramped legs, she heard the sound of singing come
from the Bethel. She had never been inside except for
Tom’s marriage, but now in a sudden softening of her
heart she thought she would go in. She opened the door,
and slid into an empty pew—of which there was a big
choice. Mr. Sumption stood swaying and heating time
in the pulpit, while before him his mean congregation of
Bourners and Hubbles sang—</p>

<p>
“Let Christian faith and hope dispel<br />
The signs of guilt and woe” ...<br />
</p>

<p>The air was heavy with the smell of lamp oil and
Sunday clothes and the rot of the plaster walls. Nell
sat, a little timid, in the corner of her pew. The scene
was strange and grotesque to her, yet rather kindly.
She thought Mr. Sumption looked ill and worn. She
was shocked at his haggard smile, at the unhealthy
smouldering of his eyes.... All Sunday Street knew
that he was in trouble again about Jerry, who had not
written for two months; but the village had come to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>

look upon it as Mr. Sumption’s natural state to be in
trouble about his son, and Nell felt there must be something
worse than usual to account for his altered looks.
Her own sadness made her soft and gentle towards him,
and she watched him with pitying eyes.</p>

<p>The service ended, and Mr. Sumption came down to
the chapel door, where he waited to shake hands with
his departing congregation. Nell, with her ignorance of
chapel ritual, had not expected this, and was a little
flustered by it. Now he must inevitably know of her
presence, which she had not meant. But there was no
help for it, so she held out her hand in her gentle, well-bred
manner as she passed him in the doorway. He gave
a start of surprise.</p>

<p>“I never expected to see you here,” he said.</p>

<p>“I was passing ... and I thought the music sounded
pretty ... so I came in,” faltered Nell.</p>

<p>“Yes—the music’s pretty,” he said absently, and she
thought his voice sounded hoarse as if from a recent cold.
Then her eyes met his, and each seemed to read the
other’s pain. Drawn together by a mystic community of
suffering, they stood for a moment in silence, still holding
hands. She felt his grip tighten on hers, and her throat
suddenly swelled with tears. They blinded her as she
went out into the dusk.</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>Shortly before Christmas Mrs. Beatup decided that
Steve Kadwell had “intentions.” He was now back at
Eastbourne, but came over to Worge every Sunday, and
after little more than half an hour beside a crushed and
plaintive Mus’ Beatup would sit in the kitchen till it was
time to go home.</p>

<p>“Never shows the end of his nose to ’em at Stilliands
Tower,” said Mrs. Beatup. “Reckon thur’s someone

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>

here he liks better.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean me?” asked Nell wearily.</p>

<p>“Well, I doan’t mean <em>me</em>—and I doan’t mean that
trug-faaced lump of an Ellen, so I reckon it’s you. You
needn’t look so black at me, Nell—thur’s no harm in a
maid getting wed. I’d bin wed a year at your age,
surelye, and three month gone wud my fust child—the
one that never opened his eyes on day.”</p>

<p>“Did father always drink?”</p>

<p>“Always a bit more or less—naun very lamentable—just
here a little and there a little, as the Bible says.
He’s got wuss this last few year. It’s that hemmed war.”</p>

<p>“You and father aren’t a very good advertisement for
marriage.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup was huffed.</p>

<p>“I dunno wot you want—here we are three years
past our silver wedding, and five strong children still
alive. It aun’t the fault of his marriage he’s bruk his
leg—he might have done it single, and you cud say the
saum of his drinking too.”</p>

<p>Further argument was prevented by the arrival of
Steve Kadwell on his Sunday visit. Nell, who had been
a little excited by her mother’s remarks, received him
with more friendliness than usual. Certainly he was a
very personable man—better-looking even than Ivy’s Corporal
Seagrim, and younger. The grip of his huge hand
gave her an extraordinary sense of well-being and self-confidence,
and the flush which always came while his
eyes appraised her was this time half pleasurable. She
fidgeted a good deal while he was upstairs.</p>

<p>His conversational powers were not great, and she suffered
a reaction of boredom during tea, which she and
her mother had ready for him when he came down. He
ate enormously and not very elegantly, though he was
not entirely a bumpkin—for he had spent an occasional
leave in London, “having a good time,” he told her with
a wink. He talked a good deal about himself and various

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>

men in his platoon, whose dull doings and sayings he
related in detail. Nell lost her new friendliness, and as
soon as tea was over went out to feed the chickens and
shut them up for the night.</p>

<p>She went into the barn to mix the feed. The sun had
just set and there was a reddish dusk, through which
she groped for the binns. She was kneading a paste
with middlings, bran and barley-meal, when she heard
a footstep on the frosty stones of the yard, and the
next minute the barn grew quite dark as a man blocked
the doorway.</p>

<p>“Your mother said I cud come and help you.”</p>

<p>Nell felt somehow a little frightened.</p>

<p>“I’m all right.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you are”—he came into the barn. “You’re
fine,” and he stooped down to her, she felt his breath
fanning her neck. Her hands ceased to move in the paste,
and suddenly she began to tremble.</p>

<p>She tried to save herself with a small, faltering
remark about the chicken-food—“Reckon soon we’ll have
to do without the meal.”</p>

<p>He did not answer, but stooped closer still, so that
she could smell him, his virile smell of hair and leather
and tobacco. Then she suddenly snatched her hands
out of the trug, all clogged and sticky with paste and
meal, and tried to push him away.</p>

<p>“Don’t ... don’t....”</p>

<p>“Nellie—you’re not afraid of me?”</p>

<p>“Please let me go”—for his arms were round her
now.</p>

<p>“Not now I’ve got you, little kid.... I’m justabout
going to keep you till I know what you’re made
of.”</p>

<p>He laughed, and her struggling passed suddenly into
weakness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Then his mouth pressed down on hers, and Nell, who
had till that moment known nothing but the bodiless
spirit of love, suddenly met him in the power of his fierce
body. The contact seemed to break her. She lay back
helpless in Kadwell’s arms, unable to stir or resist till
he let her go, and he did not let her go till he seemed to
have drawn all the life out of her in a long kiss—all the
hoard of fire and sweetness which she had kept long
years for another man he drew out of her with his lips
and took for his own.</p>

<p>Then he released her, and she fell back against the
binns, gasping a little, and crying, while her eyes strained
to him through the dusk. She seemed unable to move,
and he pointed to the bowl of chicken-food on the floor,
saying, “Pick up that trug and come out.”</p>

<p>She did as he told her, and went out meekly at his
heels.</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>Kadwell looked on Nell as a conquered kingdom. She
herself was not so sure, for after he had gone home that
night, her flagging powers revived, and she had a week
in which to recruit her forces. During that week she
passed through moments of sick revulsion from him, in
which his strength and roughness disgusted her. But
when he came again, she found herself powerless as she
had been before.</p>

<p>He had strong allies. Nell was lonely, friendless,
humbled to the dust; she was at the same time reacting
from her former intellectual and ecclesiastical influences.
His love helped restore her self-respect and his outstretched
arms were rightly placed to catch her as the
pendulum swung her away from her old tastes and
glories. Nell found herself for the first time the interesting
member of the family—at least in her mother’s

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>

eyes. She was the courted, the beloved—even if hand
in hand with love came strange tyrannies—and her sudden
change to exaltation from degradation turned her
head a little.</p>

<p>Sometimes there were hours when she saw clearly,
saw that Kadwell was impossible as her mate, that they
had nothing in common, that not even his passion was
really acceptable to her.... He was a coarse brute,
who would always trample on her tastes and wishes and
ignore her mind and soul—and in these hours she knew
that it was her mind and soul which counted most, in
spite of the newly-awakened body. She was not really
of a passionate nature, only a little drugged. She was
doping herself with Steve so that she might forget the
anguish and humiliation of the past autumn.</p>

<p>But this clearness did not last long, and it was always
fogged in the same way—by a sense of her own unworthiness.
She told herself that she was wicked to
despise Steve, who was much better than she in his
different way. He might be uneducated, coarse, and
self-willed, but he was strong and brave and resolute,
all the things that she was not—“And I say unto you,
despise not one of these little ones, for their angels do
always behold the face of my Father which is in
heaven.” ...</p>

<p>Then she would remember his wound, which he had
got fighting for her and England over at Loos, and in
the depths of that self-contempt which was so often with
her now, alternating with her moods of self-confidence,
she acknowledged that she had done nothing for the War.
Though she had always prided herself on being more
patriotic than the rest of her family, she had done far
less than they—less than Tom, who had gone to fight,
even if ignorant and unwilling; less than Harry, who had
boldly flung down his challenge to the earth and taken up

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>

arms against her for his country’s sake; less than Ivy,
who was cheerfully and competently filling a man’s place
and doing a man’s work; less than her mother, who had
borne these children for her country’s need; less even
than her father, who paid rates and taxes and cultivated
the ground. The fact that they were all, except perhaps
Harry, more or less unconscious of their service, only
made her reproach greater. She of her knowledge had
done nothing, and they of their ignorance had done much.
Who was she to despise them or Kadwell? Should she
not take this chance to do the little she could by bringing
comfort and happiness into a soldier’s life? She
knew all the difference that Thyrza had made to Tom—let
her do the same for Steve, humbly, simply, conscious
of her failure up till now.</p>

<p>Early in the New Year Bill Putland suddenly came
home on leave, and still more suddenly married a bewildered
and delighted Polly Sinden. They had not even
been definitely engaged; she had not known he was coming
home till she got his telegram, fixing not only the date
of his arrival but the date of the wedding. They were
married at Brownbread Street, by an elderly clergyman
who was taking the curate’s place during his honeymoon—Mr.
Poullett-Smith had been married up at Dallington,
and the joyful clash of his wedding chimes came to Nell
as she sat with Steve in the sun-slatted murk of the Dutch
barn, and made her more than usually submissive to his
caresses.</p>

<p>Ivy, delighted at her friend’s good luck, forgave a long
coldness, and came to Polly’s marriage. She brought
with her Sergeant Staples, and after the ceremony took
him to Worge for tea.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup had not been to the wedding, for Thyrza’s
illness had begun, and her mother-in-law had spent most
of the afternoon down at the Shop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, she’s doing valiant,” she said in answer to their
enquiries, “but ’tis unaccountable hard on a girl to be
wudout her husband at such a time....”</p>

<p>“Where’s Nell?” asked Ivy.</p>

<p>“Up wud her father, surelye. He’s bin easier to-day,
but he’s a tedious cross oald man these times. You’d
never think the pacerfist and objectious conscience he’s
got lying in bed and reading the paapers and wanting
things to eat and drink as he can’t git—reckon he’d stop
the War to-morrow for a bit of cheese.”</p>

<p>“Kadwell bin here any more?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he never misses—it’ll be Nell’s turn next after
Polly. You’d best maake haste, Ivy Beatup, or at the
raate we’re going, you’ll be the only oald maid left in
the parish.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed Ivy, with her mouth full of bread.</p>

<p>“But Nell ull be a fool if she marries him,” she added
seriously. “He aun’t her kind. I know him, and he’s
a bit of a swine, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he’s a valiant, stout chap, and Nell ull be
a fool if she says no.”</p>

<p>Ivy did not argue the matter, but before she went
away she made an opportunity to speak to her sister
alone.</p>

<p>“Nell, you haven’t promised Steve Kadwell?”</p>

<p>Nell did not answer for a moment—she looked dazed.
Then she said slowly:</p>

<p>“Yes—I promised him on Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Then write and tell him you’ve changed your mind.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re a fool. You know quite well he aun’t
the chap for you—you, wud all your liddle dentical
ways!”</p>

<p>The tears came into Nell’s eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“I love him.”</p>

<p>Ivy stared critically at her. She seemed to have
altered.</p>

<p>“Have you told mother?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“When are you going to be married?”</p>

<p>“I dunno—we haven’t talked about it yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, doan’t be in a hurry—give him a good think
over.”</p>

<p>She had no time to say more, and realised that there
was not much more to be said. Nell seemed dazed and
foolish, like a pilgrim lost in a strange land.</p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>Sunday Street was dazzled by its multitude of marriages.
There had been Tom Beatup’s, not a year ago,
then the curate’s, and Polly Sinden’s, on the top of each
other in January, and now, in February, Nell Beatup’s.
The last was a surprise; who would have thought, asked
the village, that Nell would be married before Ivy? One
or two mothers improved their daughters’ minds with the
moral of demure, gentle Nell’s marrying before her sister
with her loud, friendly ways. There was some jealousy,
too, for Kadwell, heir of Stilliands Tower, was considered
a good match, though a certain amount of suspicion attached
locally to his morals, due to his having once spent
a leave in Paris.</p>

<p>Nell’s wedding was a shorn affair. Her father was,
of course, unable to come and give her away, and she
had to go up the aisle on the arm of a shuffling and
miserable Harry, to be finally disposed of by Mrs. Beatup,
who was full of doubts as to the legality of a marriage
thus officiated. Ivy could not get another day off, so had
been obliged to content herself with sending Nell a silver-plated
cruet and a rather tactless message to “come to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>

her if ever she felt things going a bit wrong.” Thyrza
was not present, either. She had mended slowly, in spite
of the joy of her little son, and felt unequal to the fag
and excitement of a wedding, either socially or ecclesiastically.
The gaps were completed by the absence of Mr.
Poullett-Smith, who was still away on his honeymoon.
He was expected back next week, and it was considered
locally that Nell and Kadwell would have shown a more
becoming spirit if they had waited for his ministrations.
No one guessed that it was just this chance of being
married in the curate’s absence which had finally dropped
the balance, and made Nell give way to her lover’s entreaties
and make him happy at once.</p>

<p>After the ceremony there was a breakfast at Worge,
and that too was shorn. There had been no Ivy to help
Mrs. Beatup with the cooking, and trug-faced Ellen had
burnt the cake, which was not only sugarless, as Tom’s
had been, but without peel or plums. “Might as well eat
bread and call it caake,” said Mrs. Beatup drearily.
“They both taaste lik calf-meal.”</p>

<p>There was no butter, as butter did not pay at its
present price, and was no longer made at Worge. Some
greenish margarine had been Ellen’s reward for standing
two hours outside the grocer’s in Senlac, but the cake
had swallowed it all up, and wanted more, judging by its
splintering behaviour under the teeth. To balance these
scarcities there was tinned salmon and tinned crab and
tinned lobster—also two bottles of wine, left over from
Tom’s wedding, and watered to make them go further.</p>

<p>“This is wot you might call a War wedding,” said
Mrs. Beatup. “Nell, I’m unaccountable glad you got
married in church—if it had bin a chapel marriage on
the top of this”—and she waved her hand over the table—“I’d
never quite feel as you wur praaperly wed.”</p>

<p>As a further counterblast to irregularity she had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>

insisted on Nell’s being married in white satin, with a stiff
white veil like a meat-safe bound over her hair with a
wreath of artificial orange-blossom. She looked very
pretty, with a becoming flush in the thick pallor of her
skin. Her eyes were bright and restless, and she breathed
quickly, so that her little pearl-and-turquoise locket, “the
gift of the bridegroom,” heaved under her transparencies—she
was too shrinking and modest to have her gown cut
low—like a shallop on a wave. She scarcely spoke during
the meal, but sat twisting her wedding-ring and staring at
her husband—following each movement with her eyes,
apparently unable to look away from him.</p>

<p>The meal was not lively; it lacked Ivy’s good-humour,
Mus’ Beatup’s talkativeness, Bill Putland’s wit, Mr.
Sumption’s big laugh and childish enjoyment of his food.
The party consisted only of the two families—Beatups
and Kadwells. Old Mus’ Kadwell droned about the
War, and the “drore” in which he prophesied it would
end, Mrs. Kadwell compared with Mrs. Beatup a day’s
adventures in search of meat, Lizzie Kadwell tried to
flirt with Harry, who was overwhelmed with shame and
annoyance at her efforts, and Sim Kadwell, who had been
best man, gave wearying details of the Indispensable’s
Progress from tribunal to tribunal.</p>

<p>Steve Kadwell could get only a week-end’s leave, so
the honeymoon would be short, and afterwards Nell
would come back to Worge, and live there as before,
except for her “teachering,” which her husband had
made her give up, so that she might be at hand when
he wanted her, free to go with him on any unexpected
leave. He would have longer leave given him soon, he
promised her, and they would go to London and have
a valiant time. On this occasion they were going no
further that Brighton, but they would stay at a fine hotel
and have late dinner and a fire in their bedroom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Nell drove away with her hand limp and rather cold
in Kadwell’s big fondling clasp. The pale February sun
slanted to Worge’s roof from the west, and a clammy,
mould-flavoured mist hung over the hedges, like the
winter ghost of those fogs which had webbed the farm
with dusty gold in harvest-time. Nell looked back at
the old house and the fields behind it—since she was
leaving home only for two days, it was queer to feel
that she was leaving it for ever.</p>


<p>9</p>

<p>It was raining and foggy when she came back. Thick
white muffles of cloud drifted up the fields, and hung
between the hedges, catching and choking all sound. Rain
fell noiselessly, almost invisibly, apparent only in an
occasional whorl, in the dripping eaves of the stacks, the
shining roofs of the barns, and the whiteness of the
beaded grass. Nell came from Hailsham station in a
cab—her husband had told her to do so, giving her paper
money for the fare. He certainly was princely in his
ideas of spending, and there were loud and envious exclamations
at Worge when, instead of the soaked and
huddled figure expected, Nell appeared bone-dry, without
even her umbrella unfurled.</p>

<p>“A cab from Hailsham!” cried Mrs. Beatup.
“Reckon you’ve got a good husband.”</p>

<p>“And did you have the fire in your bedroom?” asked
Zacky.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Nell. “A shilling every night.”</p>

<p>She kissed her mother and brothers, and Ivy, who
was over for the day and now came out of the kitchen,
with a bear’s hug for her sister.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a new hat!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; Steve saw it in a shop in Brighton and bought
it for me.”</p>

<p>“Lork!” cried Mrs. Beatup.</p>

<p>“But it aun’t your usual style,” said Ivy; “you most-ways
wear ’em more quiet-like. I’ve seen many of that
sort of hat come on the tram, and it’s generally what the
boys call a tart.”</p>

<p>Nell flushed and looked away.</p>

<p>“We’ve got Thyrza here,” said Mrs. Beatup. “She
came up this morning afore the rain started, and we’re
kipping her till it’s a done—fust time she’s bin out, and
I’m justabout fritted lest she taakes cold.”</p>

<p>“Has she got the baby with her?”</p>

<p>“Surelye.... Here’s Nell, Thyrza, come up in a cab
from the station, and her husband’s guv her a new hat.”</p>

<p>Thyrza’s eyes opened big in wonder. She sat by the
fire, with her child in her arms; she was pale, but seemed
plump and healthy, and her eyes had an eager, yearning
look which was new to them. Nell kissed her and the
baby, and sat down by the hearth with a little shiver.</p>

<p>“I’ll git you some hot tea in a minnut,” said her
mother, “and then I’ll tell you a surprise about
Ivy.”</p>

<p>“Adone do, mother—you’ve half toald her now.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t—I only said it wur a surprise, which I
reckon it aun’t much of, since you’ve near married three
men in the last twelvemonth.”</p>

<p>Ivy groaned—“Reckon your tongue’s lik a bruk
wurzel-cutter—slipping all over the plaace. Well, Nell,
you know it now—but guess who he is.”</p>

<p>This was more difficult, as there were at least half a
dozen possible claimants, and Nell restored the secret
to a little of its lost glory by guessing wrong several
times.</p>

<p>“It’s Eric Staples,” said Ivy at last, “and we’re going

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

out to Canada soon as ever he gits his discharge, which
woan’t be long now. He wur wounded and gassed at
Vimy, but he’s a stout feller still, and has got a liddle
farm in Saskatchewan wot me and him ull kip the two
of us. He says I’m the woman born for a colonial’s
wife.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you are,” said her mother fondly, “but I wish
you cud have got a husband wot took you to hotels and
guv you cab-rides and fine hats like Nell.”</p>

<p>“I aun’t the girl fur hotels and cabs—reckon I’m only
the girl for washing the pots and scrubbing the floor, and
lucky that’s the girl Eric wants. I’d never do wud
Nell’s life—she’s a lady...” and she squeezed her
sister’s hand.</p>

<p>Nell gave a faint squeeze in response. She was
touched by Ivy’s affection, at the same time it made her
feel a little cold, for she guessed the reason; Ivy was
only saying without words, “I’m standing by you, Nell—you’ve
done a stupid thing, and nobody knows it but
you and I. Howsumdever you can always come wud any
trouble to old Ivy.”</p>

<p>Tea was now on the table, with the remains of the
wedding-cake. Mus’ Beatup was asleep upstairs, so it
was arranged that later on Nell should take him up his
tea and pay him her dutiful greetings. Harry and Zacky
came in very grubby after handling roots. Harry was
now a pitiless tyrant who drove and slaved his brother
out of school hours, making him dig and rake and cart
and dung; for the unthinkable thing of a year ago had
happened, and the War was dragging on towards Harry’s
eighteenth birthday, threatening to move his battle front
from the furrows and ditches of Sussex to the blasted
fields of France.</p>

<p>Thyrza had a letter from Tom, which she read to the
company, every now and then stopping to hum over some
passage which for obviously pleasant reasons could not
be read out loud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“To think he’s never seen his baby,” she murmured,
bending towards her crooked arm.</p>

<p>“To think of Tom ever having a baby to see,” said
Mrs. Beatup—“and you’d know he wur Tom’s by his
flat nose.”</p>

<p>“Wot have you settled to call him?” asked Ivy. “Is
it still Thomas Edward?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s to be Thomas William, fur Bill Putland has
promised to stand godfather.”</p>

<p>“I doan’t lik William as much as Edward. Wot
maade you change, Thyrza?”</p>

<p>“Tom wants him called after his best pal, surelye.”</p>

<p>“And after the Kayser, too—William’s the Kayser’s
naum.”</p>

<p>Thyrza looked shocked.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to call him Bill fur short.”</p>

<p>“That ud sound more like the Kayser than ever—I
always call the Kayser Bill.”</p>

<p>“Then call him Willie.”</p>

<p>“That’s the young Kayser, and Tom when he fixed
William said as he must never shorten it to Willie, ’cos
there’s a kind of shell called Little Willie, and he says as
if, when peace comes and he gits hoame, fulks wur to
say, ’Here comes Little Willie,’ he’d chuck himself down
in the lane and start digging himself in—Ha! ha!” and
Thyrza laughed at the joke, and tickled the baby to make
it laugh too, which it didn’t.</p>

<p>“Reckon he’s too young to laugh,” said Mrs. Beatup.</p>

<p>“He aun’t too young to cry.”</p>

<p>“We’re none of us too young fur that, nor too oald,
nuther.”</p>

<p>Thyrza sighed gently—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m unaccountable set on Tom’s coming fur the
christening—and Passon’s been wanting to christen him;
he asked me at the churching. I thought maybe Tom cud
git leave to see his baby christened, but seemingly he
can’t.”</p>

<p>“They’re unaccountable short wud leave,” said Mrs.
Beatup. “Steve couldn’t git more’n three days to git
married in.”</p>

<p>“But reckon he’ll git some more later, woan’t he,
Nell?”</p>

<p>Nell started—during the little womanly talk her mind
had gone off on questionings of its own.</p>

<p>“Leave? Yes. He’s sure to get a week before he
goes out to France.”</p>

<p>“You’re unaccountable lucky. Reckon he’ll taake you
to another hotel and buy you another hat.”</p>

<p>“And send you home in another cab.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go up and have a look at father,” said Nell.</p>

<p>There was silence in the kitchen for a little while after
she went. Harry and Zacky had gone back to their
digging, and Ivy and Mrs. Beatup sat squatting against
Thyrza’s lap, where the baby lay more helpless than a
day-old kitten.</p>

<p>“Nell’s middling quiet,” said her mother at last.</p>

<p>“She’s sad at having said good-bye to Steve,” sighed
Thyrza.</p>

<p>“I doan’t waonder as she’s vrothered,” said Mrs.
Beatup. “Courted, cried, and married, all in a huddle
lik that. Ivy, I hope as this ull be a lesson to you, and
you’ll bide your banns praaperly and buy your bits of
things in more’n one day’s shopping. Pore Nell, she sims
all swummy and of a daze, and I doan’t woander, nuther,
wud all the hurriment thur’s bin. Reckon she scarce
knows yit if she’s maid or wife.”</p>

<p>“Reckon she does,” said Ivy.</p>

<h2>PART VI: BABY</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">TOM
did not come home till March, and the baby
had been christened before he arrived, Thyrza having
proved too soft to resist ecclesiastical pressure.
But her husband was not so disappointed as she had
feared. Indeed, Tom’s whole attitude towards the
miracle she had wrought in his absence puzzled her a
little.</p>

<p>She had met him at the cottage door with the baby in
her arms, and after their first greeting he had said:</p>

<p>“Put the baby down, Thyrza. I can’t kiss you
praaperly.” Then, with his face hidden in her neck, had
murmured: “It’s my wife I want.”</p>

<p>“But aun’t you justabout pleased wud your boy,
dear?” she asked him later, when they were having tea
and eggs in a cosy blur of firelight and sunshine.</p>

<p>“Reckon I am. But babies are unaccountable ugly;
and as fur hoalding him, I’d sooner nuss a dud shell.”</p>

<p>“He aun’t ugly, Tom; everyone says he’s a justabout
lovely child—and weighs near fourteen pounds, which is
valiant fur a boy of his months.”</p>

<p>“Maybe—I know naun of babies. But you, Thyrza
... reckon you’re justabout the waonder of the world
to me.”</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears as she felt his hand groping
for hers on her knees under the table.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re just another baby,” she said tenderly.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>

“And I’m the mother of you both.”</p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>But Tom learned to be father as well as husband in
the days that followed—perhaps it was the joys of his
husbandhood which woke the fatherhood in him. It
did not quicken in a blinding flash, as motherhood had
come to Thyrza when her baby was first laid in her arms,
but grew and throve in his daily contact with the little
bit of helplessness and hope which he and Thyrza had
made between them. It seemed to develop out of and
be part of his love for her, and in time it seemed to have
a tender, mellowing effect on that love, making it less
anxious and passionate, more selfless, more sweet, more
friendly....</p>

<p>Those days were different from the days they had
spent together after their marriage. They never went
for long walks now, but stopped in their little garden at
the back of the cottage, where crocuses splashed the
grass with purple and egg-yellow, and celandines crept
in under the hedge from the fields of Egypt Farm. Here
in the warm spring sunshine Thyrza would sit, rocking
the baby’s cradle with her foot, while she talked to Tom
in her sweet, drawly voice, of the little trades and doings
of the past year. Every now and then the shop-bell would
ring through the cottage, and she would go off to serve
and gossip, leaving baby in his father’s care.... “And
doan’t you dance him, Tom, or he’ll be sick.” For Tom
was bolder now, and took perilous liberties with young
William, just as now, in his third year of soldiering, he
had begun to take them with the dud to which he had
compared him.... “Reckon he’ll start fizzing a bit
before he goes off.”</p>

<p>In the evenings, when the child was asleep in the cradle
beside their bed, they would go across the road to the
willow-pond, and sit or stroll there in the March dusk.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>

Those were wonderful days of spring, a March which
was almost May, with sweet slumberous winds, so thick
and hazy that the grumble of the unceasing guns was lost
in them, and the War’s heart-beat never broke the
meadow’s stillness. Soft primrose fogs trailed over
Horse Eye Marshes under the rising stars, and away beyond
them on the sea a siren crooned, like the voice of
the twilight and the deep.... When the sky was dark
round the big stars, and Orion’s sword hung above
Molash Woods, they would go in to their supper in the
lamplight, to the tender, intimate talk of their evening
hours, and then up, with big reeling shadows moving before
them on beam and plaster in the candlelight, to the
dim spring-smelling room where their baby slept, and
where Thyrza would sleep with her hair spread on the
pillow like a bed of celandines, and Tom with his brown,
war-calloused hand in the soft clasp of hers, and his head
in the hollow of her breast.</p>

<p>Tom, of course, paid many visits to his family at
Worge. He found Mus’ Beatup an invalid in the kitchen,
his leg propped on a chair before him. Owing to his
constitution it had mended slowly, but four months of
forced soberness had worked a wonderful result in toning
up his whole body, so that in spite of his illness his eye
was brighter, his hand steadier and his voice clearer than
at any time in Tom’s memory. Unfortunately, the boredom
and privations of his state had only increased that
“objectiousness” of disposition which Mrs. Beatup had
deplored, and Tom had to sit and listen to long harangues,
in which the War, the Christian Religion, God, Govunmunt,
Monogamy, and War Agricultural Committees
were toppled together in a common ruin. Nell no longer
argued with him, his flicks and cuts had no power to
wound, and he soon gave up trying to stir her into the
little furies which had led to so many rousing arguments.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>

It was queer how she had changed.... Her chief arguments
were with her mother, who seemed to think that
the ceremony of marriage was bound automatically to
create an abstract love of housekeeping in the female
breast. She was astonished to find that Nell had now no
greater love for making beds and washing dishes than in
the days of her spinsterhood.</p>

<p>“I never heard of a married woman as cudn’t maake
a sago pudden,” she said to Tom.</p>

<p>“She’d maake it fur her husband quick enough,” said
Tom with a grin.</p>

<p>“Well, Steve’s here most Sundays, and she’s never
maade him naun but a ginger-cake, and she used to maake
that before she wur wed.”</p>

<p>“Wait till she’s got a liddle home of her own ...
that’ll be all the difference, woan’t it, Nell?”</p>

<p>Nell smiled faintly.</p>

<p>“Would you believe it, Tom?” said Mrs. Beatup,
“but when we want a suet pudden now we’ve got to git
it off a meat-card.”</p>

<p>“We’ve heard out there as all you civvies wur on
rations—and Mus’ Archie one day he got the platoon
for a bit of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">parlez-voo</i>
and toald us as how you wurn’t starved, as so many chaps had letters
from their wives, saying as they cud git naun to eat.”</p>

<p>“Not starved! That’s valiant. And wot does Mus’
Archie know about it? Seemingly you doan’t know wot
war is out there wud all your tea and your butter and
your meat. Reckon there’ll never be peace as long as
soldiering’s the only job you can git fed at.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve guv me an unaccountable good tea fur
a starving family. And now I’ll be off and see Harry
about the farm.”</p>

<p>Worge was in the midst of its spring sowings, and
Harry spent his long days in the fields whose harvest he

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

would not see. The Volunteer field was in potash now,
dug for potatoes, and there were six more acres of
potatoes over by the Sunk.</p>

<p>“They say as how a hunderd acres of potatoes ull
feed four hunderd people fur a year,” he said to Tom—“and
yit thur’s always summat unaccountable mean
about a spud.”</p>

<p>Tom laughed. “You’ve done valiant, Harry.” Now
that his brother’s adventure had justified itself, he had
abandoned a good deal of his croaking attitude. Besides,
if things really were getting scarce at home ... he
wouldn’t like to think of Thyrza and the baby....</p>

<p>“I’ve done my best,” said Harry moodily, “but it’s
over now. Reckon I’ll be called up in two months’
time.”</p>

<p>“Who’d have thought it!—you eighteen!—and the
liddle skinny limb of wickedness you wur when I went
away. I’d never have believed it, if you’d toald me that
in two year you’d have maade more of Worge than I in
five.”</p>

<p>“Father wants me to appeal; but it ud never do, I
reckon. You cudn’t git off, so I’m not lik to.”</p>

<p>“And it wouldn’t be praaper, nuther,” said Tom, rather
huffily. “You wud a brother in the Sussex! Farming’s
all very well, Harry, but soldiering’s better. I didn’t
think it myself at one time, but now I know different.
A farm’s hemmed liddle use if Kayser Bill gits his perishing
plaace in the sun. Besides, the praaper job fur a
praaper Sussex chap is along of other Sussex chaps, fighting
fur their farms. That’s whur I’d lik my old brother
to be, and whur he’d like to be himself, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I shudn’t,” said Harry, “any more than you did at
fust.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“I aun’t maaking out as I enjoy it—so you needn’t
jump at me lik that. The chap who tells you he enjoys
it out thur, reckon he taakes you fur a middling thick
’un, or he’s middling thick himself. But wot I say is,
that it’s the praaper plaace fur a Sussex chap to be.
Ask me wot I enjoy, and I’ll tell you”—and Tom jerked
his pipe-stem over the ribbed hump of the field towards
the cottages of Sunday Street, stewing like apples in the
sunshine. “My fancy’s a liddle hoame of my own, and
a wife and child in it, and my own bit of ground outside
the door; and when we’ve wound up the watch on
the Rhine, reckon I’ll be justabout glad to taake my
coat off and sit in the sun and see my liddle ’un playing
raound—and be shut of all that tedious hell wot’s over
thur, Harry, acrost Horse Eye and the Channel, if folks
at home only knew it—which seemingly they doan’t ...
and I’m middling glad they doan’t, surelye.”</p>

<p>Harry was impressed, and a little ashamed.</p>

<p>“Never think as I aun’t willing, Tom. I’m willing
enough, though I’d grown so unaccountable set on the
new ploughs. Howsumdever, I’ve got things started like,
and Zacky, maybe, when I’m gone, he’ll pull to and carry
on, saum as I did; and father, he’s twice the head he had
afore he bruk his leg and cudn’t git his drink. Seemingly,
they’ll do valiant wudout me, and I ... well, I’ve
come to love these fields so middling dear that if one day
I find I’ve got to die fur them, reckon I shudn’t ought
to mind much.”</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>“I must go and see Mus’ Sumption,” said Tom to
Thyrza. He said it several times before he went, for the
days swam in a golden fog over his home, shutting him
into enchanted ground. It was hard to break out of it
even to go to Worge, and he found himself shelving the
thought of leaving for two hours of worse company the
little garden where the daffodils followed the crocuses,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>

the shop all stuffy with the smell of tea and candles,
the bluish-whiteness of the little sag-roofed rooms, and
his wife and child, who were not so much figures in the
frame of it all as an essence, a sunshine soaking through
it.... However, Thyrza kept him to his word.</p>

<p>“I’m tedious sorry fur Mus’ Sumption—he looks that
worn and wild. Maybe you cud give him news of
Jerry.”</p>

<p>“No good news.”</p>

<p>“Well, go up and have a chat wud the pore soul.
Reckon he’ll be mighty glad to see you, and you’re sure
to think of summat comforting to say.”</p>

<p>So Tom went, one evening after tea. He found the
minister in his faded threadbare room at the Horselunges,
writing the letter which every week he dropped
into the post-box at Brownbread Street, and generally
heard no more of. The evening sun poured angrily on
his stooped grey head, and made the room warm and
stuffy without the expense of a fire. The old, old cat
sat sulkily before the empty grate, and the white mice
tapped with little pink hands on the glass front of their
cage. The thrush had been dead some months.</p>

<p>“Hello, Tom. This is kind of you, lad,” and Mr.
Sumption sprang up in hearty welcome, shaking Tom by
the hand, and actually tipping the cat out of the armchair
so that his visitor might be comfortably seated.</p>

<p>Tom sat down and pulled out his pipe, and for some
minutes they edged and skated about on general topics.
Then the minister asked suddenly—</p>

<p>“And how did you leave Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Valiant”—certainly Jeremiah Meridian Sumption
was a hardy, healthy little beggar.</p>

<p>But Mr. Sumption was not deceived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Valiant in body, maybe. But, Tom, I fear for his
immortal soul.”</p>

<p>Tom did not know wat to say. He had never before
seen the minister without his glorious pretence of faith
in his son.</p>

<p>“It’s strange,” continued Mr. Sumption, “but from his
birth that boy was seemingly marked out by Satan.
Maybe it was the bad blood of the Rossarmescroes or
Hearns; his mother was the sweetest, loveliest soul that
ever slept under a bush; but there’s no denying that the
Hearns’ blood is bad blood—roving, thieving, lusting,
Satanic blood—and he’s got it in him, has my boy, more
than he’s got the decent blood of my fathers.”</p>

<p>“Has he written to you lately?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he writes now and again. He’s fond of me.
But he doesn’t sound happy. Then Bill Putland, when
he came home to get married, he told me——”</p>

<p>There was silence, and Tom fidgeted.</p>

<p>“He told me as Jerry had got hold of a French girl
in one of the towns—a bad lot, seemingly.”</p>

<p>“He’ll get over it,” said Tom. “Reckon he can’t have
much love fur such a critter.”</p>

<p>“You knew of it too, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ve all heard. He got First Field Punishment
on her account, fur——”</p>

<p>“Go on.”</p>

<p>“Thur’s naun to say. I guess she’s bad all through.
Some of these girls, they’re bits of stuff as you might
say, but they’d never kip a man off his duty or git him
into trouble on their account. Howsumdever, the wuss
she is the sooner he’s lik to git shut of her.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption groaned.</p>

<p>“If only he could have married your sister Ivy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ivy aun’t to blame.”</p>

<p>“No—she’s not. I mustn’t be unjust. She treated
him fair and square all through; he says it himself. But,
Tom, it’s terrible to think that one human creature’s got
the power to give another to Satan, and no blame attached
to either.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Jerry wur Satan’s before he wur Ivy’s,” said
Tom sharply; then felt ashamed as he met the minister’s
eyes with their tortured glow.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right. This is Satan’s hour. He’s got
us all for a season, and this War is his last kick before
the Angel of the Lord chains him down in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone. These are the days of
which the Scripture saith, that unless the Lord should
shorten them for the Elect’s sake, no man could be
saved.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ve nearly done the Lord’s job. The perishers
are even more fed up than us, which is putting it
strong. Let ’em start this Big Push of theirn as thur’s
bin such a talk about. Doan’t you vrother about Jerry,
Mus’ Sumption—he’ll be shut of this girl before long,
and you’ll git him back here and wed him to a good soul
as ull do better fur him than Ivy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption shook his head.</p>

<p>“This is the war which shall end the world.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I aun’t going out there, away from my wife
and child and home, all among the whizz-bangs and the
coal-boxes, and git all over mud and lice, jest to help on
the end of the world. This world’s good enough fur me,
and I hope it’ll go on a bit longer after peace is signed,
so as I’ll git a chance of enjoying it.”</p>

<p>“And they shall reign with Him a thousand years.”</p>

<p>Tom was a little weary of Mr. Sumption in this mood;
however, he felt sorry for him, and let him run on.</p>

<p>“You must be blind indeed,” continued the minister,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>

“if you don’t see how the Scriptures have been fulfilled—nation
against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and
the Holy City given back to the Jews, and the sun turned
to darkness with the clouds of poisoned gas, and the moon
to blood ... the blood of the poor souls that are killed
in moonlight air-raids....”</p>

<p>Tom knocked out his pipe.</p>

<p>“Then at last”—and the minister’s eye kindled and
his whole sunburnt face glowed with the mixed fires of
hope and fanaticism—“the sign of the Son of Man shall
appear in the heavens, and He shall come again in power
and great glory. Even so, come, Lord Jesus—but come
before our hearts are all broken. What’s the use of
chaining up the Dragon in the Lake if he’s already devoured
the world? Shorten these days, for the Elect’s
sake—save us from the burning, fiery furnace which is
making frizzle of our bones and cinders of our
hearts.”</p>

<p>He suddenly dropped his head between his hands.
Tom felt a bit upset. He had again and again heard all
this in chapel, but it was embarrassing and rather alarming
to have it coming from the next chair.</p>

<p>“Reckon you mind this War more’n I do,” he remarked
lamely.</p>

<p>“Because to you it is just war—while to me it’s Judgment.
This is the day of which the Prophet spoke, the
day that shall burn as an oven, and our sons and daughters
shall burn as tow.... Bless you, young chap!
there have been other wars—the country’s full of their
dead names ... there were two lakes of blood up at
Senlac.... But this war, it’s the End, it’s Doomsday.
Now it shall be proved indeed that Christ died for the
Elect, for all save the Elect shall perish. Tom, I have
a terrible fear that I shall have to stand by and see my
boy perish.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll pull through right enough—give him his
head and he’ll come to his senses afore long.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not.” Mr. Sumption rose and began
walking up and down the room, his hands clasped behind

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>

him. The dipping sun poured over his burly figure, showing
up in its beautiful merciless beam the seediness of
his coat and the worn hollows and graven lines of his
face. “I’m afraid not, Tom Beatup. I’m afraid I’ll have
to stand by and see my boy damned. I’ll stand among
the sheep and see him among the goats. There’s no good
trying to job myself into thinking he’s one of the Elect—he
knows he isn’t, and I know it. Whereas I have
Assurance—I’ve had it a dunnamany years. Between us
two there is a great gulf fixed. I’ll have to dwell for
ever in Mount Sion, in the general assembly and church
of the firstborn, and see him for ever across the gulf,
in hell.”</p>

<p>“Then reckon you’ll be in hell yourself.”</p>

<p>“It seems like it. But the ways of the Lord are past
finding out.... And I would willingly give my soul
for Jerry’s—the soul the Lord has damned from the
womb....”</p>

<p>Tom stood up. He felt he could not stand any more
of this.</p>

<p>“Seemingly your religion aun’t much of a comfort to
you.... Well, I must be going now.”</p>

<p>“You’ll come again?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I will, if you’re lonesome.”</p>

<p>“And look here, Tom; you won’t say a word to other
folk of what I’ve spoken—about Jerry, I mean. It ud
never do if the parish came to think that he was getting
into bad ways.”</p>

<p>“I’ll say naun—trust me. Reckon Jerry’s middling
lucky to have you stick by him as you do.”</p>

<p>“Jerry once said he sometimes felt as if there was
only me between him and hell. Seemingly I’m the only
friend he’s got.”</p>

<p>Tom felt very sorry for Mr. Sumption. He told
Thyrza that he thought he must be getting queer with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>

his troubles, and Thyrza immediately planned to take
the baby to see him; and a day or two later they asked
him down to the shop for the afternoon, and had the
pleasure of seeing him momentarily forget his troubles
in a good tea. “Reckon the poor soul thinks a lot of
his inside,” said Thyrza, “and doan’t always git enough
to fill it with.”</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>The last days of Tom’s fortnight seemed to rush by
in spate; they blew before the March wind like the dust.
Thyrza hurried on her little preparations for his departure—she
was making him new shirts, and with loving
hands repairing all of his that was frayed and worn,
from his shirt to his soul.... For even Tom’s simple
soul had been touched by the blight of war, and there
was a look at the back of his eyes which came from
things he never spoke of ... things he had seen out
there in the land of horrors, which the folk at home did
not realise—and he was unaccountable glad they did not.
Thyrza’s love had driven that look to the back of his
eyes and those memories to the back of his heart, though
probably she would never be able to drive either the look
or the memories quite away. Such things were now the
lot of boys....</p>

<p>He still went occasionally to Worge, and sat with his
father and mother in the kitchen, or gave Harry a hand
on the farm. He persuaded Mus’ Beatup to engage a
lad for cow and stable work, so that his brother’s burden
was made lighter. One day Ivy came over with Sergeant
Staples. The slow formalities of his discharge were
crawling on, and she hoped to be married and to sail
for Canada before the summer was out. It struck Tom
that she had sweetened and sobered since he saw her last.
Rumours of her affair with Seagrim had reached him,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>

and he was glad to have her settled down. “Ricky’s a
valiant pal,” she said once, and the words struck the difference
between her love for him and the love she had
had for Seagrim, and would have explained, if anyone
had cared for an explanation, the comparative ease and
quickness with which she had turned from one to the
other. Seagrim had never been a pal—he had been a
spell, a marvel, a magic that would never come back, a
wonder which a woman’s heart must know but can
seldom keep. Ricky, with his red hair and grinning
monkeyish face, would never throw over Ivy’s world the
glamour of those weeks with Seagrim, he would never
transfigure the earth or turn pots to gold.... On the
other hand, as Ivy said, he was better to jog along with,
and she was certainly born for the ardours and endurances
of a colonial’s wife—“So that’s settled and done
with,” she thought to herself with a contented sigh—“and
I reckon I’m a middling lucky girl. It’s queer how Nell
and me have seemingly done just the saum—lost our
hearts to one man and then gone and married another.
But I kept my head and did it sensible, while she, reckon
she lost hers and did it unsensible. Poor Nell! ...
but I told her straight as Kadwell wur a swine.”</p>

<p>Nell had left the farm about four days after Tom’s
return. Her husband had suddenly claimed her, and had
fetched her away to spend his last leave with him in
London. He expected to go to France in a week or two
now. Tom did not dislike his new brother-in-law; he
thought him a “good feller,” and considered him wonderfully
forbearing with Nell when she cried on saying
good-bye to her mother, and went away with her pretty
face all marbled and blotched with tears.</p>

<p>“I’ve got no patience wud girls wot taake on them
silly maidenish airs,” he said to Thyrza. “You never

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>

cried when you caum to me, surelye.”</p>

<p>“I’d no mother to say good-bye to. Some girls always
cry when they say good-bye to their mothers.”</p>

<p>“Nell never used to be so set on mother in the oald
times.”</p>

<p>“But it’s different now—it always is,” said Thyrza
wisely—“that’s why some folks ud sooner have a darter
than a son. When a son goes marrying he turns away
from his parents, but a girl, the more she loves outside
the more she loves at home.”</p>

<p>Tom pondered her words, and found himself beginning
to feel a little guilty.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right. I hope Will woan’t go and disremember
us when he weds.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he will,” said Thyrza—“it’s only nature.”</p>

<p>Tom went up to Worge every evening till the end of
his leave.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>The last evening came, and Tom’s good-byes.</p>

<p>“Reckon it’s always ‘good-bye’ now,” said Mrs.
Beatup. “Good-bye to Ivy, good-bye to Nell, good-bye
to Tom—sims as if, as if that ward ud git lik my
oald broom, wore out from overuse.”</p>

<p>“Thur’d be no good-byes if thur hadn’t bin howdy-dos
fust. So cheer up, mother, and we’ll be saying
howdy-do agaun before Michaelmas.”</p>

<p>“And then good-bye. Oh, Tom, when ull this tedious
war have done?”</p>

<p>“When it’s finished. Doan’t you fret over that, mother—reckon
that aun’t your job.”</p>

<p>“I wish it ud have done, though, before our hearts
are broke.”</p>

<p>Nell was expected home that evening, and Mrs. Beatup
persuaded Tom to wait for her. He spent the interval
going over the farm with Harry, and giving last advice,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>

though it was astonishing how firm on his legs his brother
now stood. He also took his chance of a straight talk
with Zacky.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re growing up lik a young colt, and you’ll
have to taake your turn now—step into Harry’s plaace
saum as he stepped into mine.”</p>

<p>Zacky’s besetting sin was not a lust for adventure in
woods and distant fields; he moved in a more humdrum
circle of dereliction—marbles and conkers and worms and
string. However, Tom discovered that he had a passion
for “taking things to pieces” and hoped to inspire him
to zeal over the new mechanical reaper which was that
year to be the wonder of Worge’s harvest.</p>

<p>To everyone’s disappointment, Nell did not arrive in
a cab. She came on foot from Senlac station, leaving
her box to follow by the carrier. Mrs. Beatup felt that
Tom had been cheated, on his last day at home, of a fine
spectacular entertainment, and was inclined to be peevish
with Nell on his account.</p>

<p>“Reckon it wurn’t your husband who told you to walk
six mile in the dust.”</p>

<p>“No—but it’s such a beautiful evening, and I felt I
wanted the fresh air after London.”</p>

<p>She looked worn and fagged, as she sat down by the
fire, spreading out her pale hands to the flames to warm.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup sniffed.</p>

<p>“Reckon thur’s more air-raids than air in London,”
said Tom—“Ha! ha!” and they all laughed at the joke.</p>

<p>“But they dudn’t have naun while Nell was there,”
said Mrs. Beatup, continuing her grumble. “Nell, how
dud you lik the Strand Paliss Hotel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty fair—it was very grand, but a great big
barrack like that makes my head turn round.”</p>

<p>“How big was it?” asked Zacky. “As big as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>

church?”</p>

<p>“Bigger a dunnamany times,” said Mrs. Beatup.
“I’ve seen the Hotel Metropoil in Brighton, and reckon
you cud git the whole street into it.”</p>

<p>“Did you have a fire in your bedroom?”</p>

<p>“No—there were hot pipes.”</p>

<p>“Hot pipes! How queer!—I shud feel as if I wur
in a boiler.”</p>

<p>“And there was hot and cold water laid on.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you washed.”</p>

<p>“I had a bath.”</p>

<p>“In your room?”</p>

<p>“No—in a bathroom.”</p>

<p>“A real white bath in a bathroom!...” Mrs. Beatup
was regaining confidence in her daughter. “You’ll be
gitting too grand fur us here. They say as once you
start taaking baths it’s like taaking drams, and you
can’t git shut of it. I’ll have to see if I can’t fix fur you
to have the wash-tub now and agaun.... Oh, you’ll
find us plain folks here.”</p>

<p>Nell did not speak; she was stooping over the fire
and her spread hands shook a little.</p>

<p>“Reckon she’s low,” said Mrs. Beatup in a hoarse
whisper to Tom; “she’s said good-bye to her man, and
she’s vrothering lest he never comes back. It’s always
’good-bye’ fur her lik fur the rest of us.”</p>

<p>“It’ll have to be ‘good-bye’ fur me now, mother. I
must be gitting hoame.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup stood up sorrowfully—</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, I’ve a feeling as you’ll never come back.”</p>

<p>“You’ve always had that feeling, mother—and I’ve
always come back, surelye.”</p>

<p>“But maybe I’m right this time. They say as the Germans
ull maake a gurt push this Spring, and I reckon
they’re sure to kill you if they can.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reckon they’ll have a try—and if my number’s up
I mun go, and if it aun’t, I mun stay. So thur’s no sense
in vrothering.”</p>

<p>“You spik very differunt, Tom, from when you wur
a lad.”</p>

<p>“I feel different, you can bet.”</p>

<p>“And yit it’s scarce two year agone since you wur
naun but a boy, and now you’re naun of a boy that I
can see—you’re a married man and the father of a
child.”</p>

<p>“And whur’s the harm of it?—you needn’t look so
glum.”</p>

<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her. Then he
kissed his father—</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dad—you’ll be climbing fences afore I’m
back, and—” in a friendly whisper, “you kip away from
that old Volunteer. See wot gitting shut of the drink has
maade you—you’re twice the man, fur all your leg. You
kip on wud it, faather. You’ve got a start like—it ought
to be easy now.”</p>

<p>“Kip on wud wot, my lad?—wud my leg, or the drink,
or doing wudout the drink? You doan’t spik clear and
expressly—reckon you’re gitting just a brutal soldier.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I am, Faather.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll never come raound me to kip teetotal when
I think of them Russians—all got shut of drink the fust
month of the war, and then went and bust up and ruined
us. It’s bin proved as the war ull go on a dunnamany
years on account of them valiant teetotallers. If we
British all turn teetotal too, reckon as the war ull last fur
ever.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ve got the brains!” said Tom, but not in
quite the same tone as he used to say it.</p>

<p>He said good-bye to Harry and Zacky, and to Nell—with
a pat on her shoulder and a “Doan’t you fret, my

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>

dear—he’ll come back.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup went down with him to the end of the
drive. She looked on this as her privilege, and also had
some hazy idea about giving him good advice. All she
could think of on the present occasion was to “Kip sober
and finish the war.”</p>

<p>“Wish that being my faather’s son maade it as easy
to do one as it does to do t’other. Now doan’t you start
crying, fur I tell you I’ll be back before you scarce know
I’m a-gone.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer, Tom ... now, thur’s summat I want to
know. Tell me—is a wife better than a mother?”</p>

<p>“Better—but different. Doan’t you fear, mother. I’ll
always want you. Maybe I went and disremembered you
and faather a bit after I wur married, but now I’ve a
youngster of my own it just shows me a liddle bit of
wot you feel ... and I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>He suddenly kissed her work-soiled, roughened hand,
with its broken nails and thick dull wedding-ring sunk
into the gnarled finger.</p>

<p>“That’s wot they do to ladies in France.”</p>


<h3>6</h3>

<p>She watched him walk off down the Street, stopping
to light his pipe where the oast of Egypt Farm made a
lee against the racing wind. Then she walked slowly and
heavily back to the house, planning a little consolation
for herself in listening to Nell’s tale of wonders.</p>

<p>But when she came to the kitchen she found that
Nell had gone upstairs—to wash, Mus’ Beatup told her.
Moved by a spasm of tenderness, she took the kettle from
the fire and creaked off with it to her daughter’s room.</p>

<p>Knocking at bedroom doors was a refinement unknown
at Worge. Mrs. Beatup accordingly burst in, to find Nell
sitting on the bed, with her face hidden in her hands.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>

She had taken off her gown, and sat arrayed in a short
silk petticoat and an under-bodice of a transparency that
made her mother gasp; over her shoulders was nothing
but two pale-blue ribbons, against which her arms showed
yellowish-white and plumper than they used to be. So
astonished was Mrs. Beatup at this display that she
scarcely noticed the hidden face.</p>

<p>“Nell, how fine! But you’ll catch your death—I
wonder your husband let you....” Her voice trailed
off, for Nell had dropped her hands, and her face was
running with tears.</p>

<p>“My poor liddle girl!”—the mother’s heart went out
in pity. She put the kettle on the floor, and going over
to the bed, sat down on it with a great creaking of
springs, and put her arms round her daughter—at first
rather gingerly, for fear of spoiling so much elegance,
then straining them closer, as Nell, melted into an abandonment
of weakness, began to sob against her breast.</p>

<p>“My poor liddle girl!... It’s unaccountable sad
fur you. I know.... I know.... But doan’t you
vrother, chick—he’ll come back. I’ve a feeling as he’ll
come back.”</p>

<p>A long shudder passed through Nell. Then suddenly
she raised herself, gripping her mother’s arms, while her
eyes blazed through her tears. “Oh, mother, mother
... don’t you see? ... it’s not that I’m afraid he
won’t come back ... it’s that I’m afraid he will.”</p>

<p>She threw herself down upon the pillow, sobbing with
the accumulated misery, humiliation, rage and dread of
weeks. Mrs. Beatup stared at her, dumbfounded.</p>

<p>“Nell—wot are you talking of? You doan’t want
Steve to come back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>


<p>“No—I hate him. I—I ... if he comes back ...
and takes me away to be my husband for good, I—I’ll
kill myself.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you doan’t know what you’re saying. You
loved him unaccountable when you wur wed.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t love him ... not truly. And he’s killed
the little love I had.”</p>

<p>“But all the fine things he’s guv you....”</p>

<p>“Doan’t talk about them. They’re just part of the
horribleness.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re telling me as you maade a mistake?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I did. Reckon my only chance now is that
he won’t come back.”</p>

<p>She began to sob again, not tempestuously, but slowly
and painfully, gradually jerking to silence. A soft green
twilight deepened in the room, and the low gurgling calls
of starlings trilled under the eaves. The mother still sat
on the bed-foot, staring at her daughter, who now lay
still, a pool of blue in the dusk with her silk petticoat, her
shoulders showing nacreous against the dead-white of the
pillow. Mrs. Beatup was stunned, her mind slowly adjusting
itself to the revelation that there was in war
another tragedy besides the tragedy of those who do not
come back—and that is the tragedy of some who do.</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>The dipping sun slanted over the fields from Stilliands
Tower, and made Tom Beatup’s khaki like a knight’s
golden armour as he trudged home. The sky was a
spread pool of blue, full of light like water, and moss-green
in the east where it dipped towards the woods of
Senlac. Soft whorls of dust bowled down the lane before
a fluttering, racing wind, that smelled of primroses
and rainy grass.</p>

<p>Tom heaved a deep sigh of well-being as he stopped
to light his pipe. To-morrow he would have left these
sun-swamped sorrowless fields and be back in the country

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>

where the earth was torn and gutted as if by an earthquake,
all scabbed and leprous as if diseased with the
putrefaction of its million dead—where the air rocked
with crashes, roars, rumbles, whizzes, caterwaulings, and
reeked with flowing stenches of dead bodies, blood, and
hideous chemicals—where any thornbush might conceal a
sight of horror to freeze heart and eyeballs ... and
yet he could put the dread of it out of his mind, and
smile contentedly, and blink his eyes in the sun.</p>

<p>A few yards down the street his cottage showed its
little misted shape, while its windows shone like garnets
in the western radiance, and a tall column of wood-smoke
rose behind it, blowing and bowing in the adventurous
wind, which brought him snatches of its perfume, with
the sweetness of wet banks and primroses and budding
apple-boughs.... He knew that in the shop door Thyrza
stood with the baby in her arms; she would be waiting
for him there with the sunshine swimming over her white
apron and purple gown, making the downy fluff on little
Will’s head to shine yellow as a duckling’s feathers. The
thought of wife and child was not cankered by the dread
that he might never see them again. The parting when
it came would be terrible—he might break down over it,
as he had broken down before—but he had all a soldier’s
solid fatalism and scorn of the future, and was, perhaps,
strengthened by the inarticulate knowledge that if he were
to die to-morrow he died a man complete. From the
lumbering, unawakened lad of two years ago he had
come to a perfect manhood, to be a husband and father,
fulfilling himself in a simple, natural way, with a quickness
and richness which could never have been if the war
had not seized him and forced him out of his old groove
into its adventurous paths. If he died, the war would but
have taken away what it had given—a man; for through
it he had in a short time fulfilled a long time, and at

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>

twenty-two could die in the old age of a complete, unspotted
life.</p>

<p>He passed under the sign of the Rifle Volunteer, straddling
the road in his green uniform, with his rifle and pot
of beer—“Queer old perisher,” thought Tom, looking
up at him—“I shudn’t like to go over the top in that rig.”</p>

<p>The Rifle Volunteer creaked noisily on his sign, as if
the soldier of bygone years challenged the soldier of
to-day.</p>

<p>“I am the man armed for the War That Never Was,
who marched and drilled and camped to fight the French,
who never came. And you are the man unarmed for the
War That Had To Be, who never drilled or marched or
camped to fight the Germans, who came and nearly drove
you off the earth.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he’d have bin most use a hunderd mile
away,” scoffed Tom.</p>

<p>“I went of my free-will and you because you were
fetched,” said the Rifle Volunteer. “Two years ago I
saw you walking down this road under my patriotic legs,
a wretched, drag-heel conscript.”</p>

<p>“He never fought in any war that I know of,” thought
Tom, “and yit I reckon thur used to be wars in these
parts in the oald days. Minister says the country’s full
of thur naums. I doan’t know naun, surelye.”</p>

<p>The east wind blew from Senlac, sweet with the scent
of the ash-trees growing on the barrow where Saxon and
Norman lay tumbled together in the brotherhood of
sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here—when a great whinny moor rolled down from
Anderida to the sea, and Pevens Isle and Horse Isle were
green in the bight of the bay, and the family of the
Heastings had finished building their ham by the coast—here
used to be the Lake of Blood, where hearts were
drowned. A red tun stands on it now, and good folk
come to it on market-days. Thus shall it be with all wars—out
of the red blood the red town, and under the green
barrows friend and foe, tumbled together in the brotherhood
of sleep.”</p>

<p>The east wind like a Saxon ghost whistled against
Tom’s neck.</p>

<p>“We fought as you did once—we hated the Norman
as you hate the German, yet look how peacefully we sleep
together.”</p>

<p>“They must have been funny,” thought Tom, “those
oald wars wud bows and arrows.”</p>

<p>“Harold! Harold!... Rollo! Rollo!” cried the
ghosts on the east wind from Senlac.</p>

<p>“God save the Queen,” said the Rifle Volunteer.</p>

<h2>PART VII: MR. SUMPTION</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was early in April. A soft fleck of clouds lay over
the sky, so thin, so rifted, that the sinking lights
of afternoon bloomed their hollows with cowslip. A
misty warmth hung over the fields, drawing up the perfume
of violets and harrowed earth, of the soft clay-mud
of the lanes, not yet dry after a shower and with puddles
lying in the ruts like yellow milk.</p>

<p>Sunday Street was in stillness, like a village in a
dream. Thin spines of wood-smoke rose from its chimneys,
blue against the grey dapple of the clouds. The
chink of a hammer came from the Forge, but so muffled,
so rhythmic that it seemed part of the silence. The
watery atmosphere intensified that effect of dream and
illusion which the village had that evening. Through it
the cottages and farms showed with a watery clearness
and at the same time a strange air of distance and
unreality. There was flooding light, yet no sunshine,
distinctness of every line in eaves and tiling, of every
daffodil and primrose in garden-borders, and yet that
peculiar sense as of something far away, intangible, a
mirage painted on a cloud. It was thus that the vision
of his home might rise before the stretched, abnormal
sight of a dying man, a simulacrum, a fetch....</p>

<p>Thyrza Beatup sat beside the willow pond at the corner
of the Street, on the trunk of a fallen tree. In her arms
she held her baby, asleep in a shawl. She felt warm and
content and rather sleepy. In her pocket was Tom’s last

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>

letter from France, but she did not read it, for she knew
it by heart.... “I think of you always, you dear little
creature, you and baby—even when my mind is full of
the things out here, and this great battle which is seemingly
the biggest there’s ever been.” ... “How I wonder
when I’ll get another leave. I reckon baby ull have
grown a bit and you’ll be just the same.” ... “I shut
my eyes and I can see your face; reckon I love you more
every time I think of you and I think of you day and
night, so you can guess all the love that makes.” ...
Tender phrases floated in and out of her mind, and then
she smiled as she remembered a funny story Tom had
told her about a chap in the A.S.C....</p>

<p>She drew the baby closer into her arms, looking down
at his little sleeping face, which she thought was growing
more and more like Tom’s. She drooped her eye-lids
and in the mist of her lashes half seemed to see
Tom’s face there in the crook of her elbow, where it had
so often been, turning towards her breast. Poor Tom!
his head was not so softly pillowed these nights ... and
as suddenly she pictured him lying on the bare, foul
ground, his head on his haversack, his cheeks unshaved,
his body verminous, his limbs all aching with cold and
stiffness—he, her man, her darling, whom she would
have had rest so sweetly and so cleanly, with nothing but
sweetness and comfort for the body that she loved—then
a sudden flame of rebellion blazed up in her heart, and
its simplicity was scarred with questions—Why was this
terrible War allowed to be? How was it that women
could let their men go to endure its horrors? Did anyone
in England ever yet know what it was these boys had
to suffer? Oh, stop it, stop it! for the sake of the boys
out there, and for the boys who have still to go ...
save at least a few straight limbs, a few unbroken hearts.</p>

<p>She clenched her hands, and little Will moaned against

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>

her breast, and as she felt his little fists beating against
her, the hard mood softened, and she bent over him with
soothing words and caresses—words of comfort for herself
as well as for her child.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, liddle Will—daddy ull come back—daddy’s
thinking of us. He’s out there so that you ull never have
to go; he bears all that so that you may never have to
bear it.”</p>

<p>A thick grape red had trickled into the west like a spill
of wine. The afternoon had suddenly crimsoned into the
evening, and ruddy lights came slanting over the fields,
deepening, reddening, so that the willows were like
flames, and the willow pond was like a lake of blood....
The night wind rose, and Thyrza shivered.</p>

<p>“We mun be gitting hoame, surelye,” and she stood
up, pulling the shawl over the baby’s face.</p>

<p>At the same time her heart was full of peace. The
questioning mood had passed, and had given place to
one single deep assurance of her husband’s love. Tom’s
love seemed to go with her into the house, to be with
her as she bathed Will and put him to bed, to drive
away her brooding thoughts when, later on, she sat
alone in the lamplight at her supper. She sang to herself
as she put away the supper, a silly old song of Tom’s
when he first joined up:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
  </div>
    </div>

<p>Now that darkness had fallen, the clouds had rolled
away from the big stars blinking in the far-off peace.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>

A soft, sweet-smelling cold was in the house, the emanation
of the damp mould of the garden, where hyacinths
bathed their purples and yellows in the white flood of
the moon—of the twinkling night air, cold and clear as
water—of the fields with their brown moist ribs and
clumps of violets.</p>

<p>Thyrza’s room was full of light, for the westering
moon hung over Starnash like a sickle, and the fields
showed grey against their hedges and the huddled woods.
She undressed without a candle, so bright was the moon-dazzle
on her window, and after saying her prayers
climbed into bed, where little Will now lay in his
father’s place. Once more she tried to picture that his
head was Tom’s, and that her husband lay beside her,
while Will slept in his cradle, as he had slept when Tom
was at home. But the illusion faltered—Will was so
small, and Tom was so big in spite of his stockiness, and
took up so much more room, making the mattress cant
under him, whereas Will lay on it as lightly as a kitten.
However, she did not badly need the comfort of make-believe,
for her sense of Tom’s love was so real, so intense,
and so sweet, that it filled all the empty corners of
her heart, making her forget the empty corners of her
bed. She lay with one arm flung out towards the baby,
the other curved against her side, while her hair spread
over the pillow like a bed of celandines, and the moonlight
drew in soft gleams and shadows the outlines of her
breast.</p>

<p>She lay very still—nearly as still as Tom was lying in
the light of the same moon.... But not quite so still,
for the stillness of the living is never so perfect, so
untroubled as the stillness of the dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>


<h3>2</h3>

<p>Worge knew nearly as soon as the Shop, for Nell,
running down after breakfast to buy tobacco for her
father, found the blinds still drawn. The door was
unlocked, however, so she went in and called her sister-in-law.
There was no answer, and, vaguely alarmed,
she went upstairs, to find Thyrza sitting on the unmade
bed, still wearing the print wrapper she had slipped on
when the shop-bell rang during her dressing.</p>

<p>“I must go and tell his mother,” she kept repeating,
when Nell had read the telegram, and had set about, with
true female instinct, to make her a cup of tea.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry over that, dear—I’ll tell her.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he’d sooner I did.”</p>

<p>“No—no; it would be such a strain for you. I’ll go
when I’ve made your tea.”</p>

<p>At that moment little Will woke up, and cried for his
breakfast—his mother had forgotten him for the first
time since he was born. Nell welcomed the distraction,
though her heart tightened as she saw Thyrza’s arms
sweep to the child, and quiver while she held him with
his little cool tear-dabbled cheek against her own so tearless
and so dry. Nell left her with the boy at her
breast, a big yellow hank of hair adrift upon her shoulder,
and her eyes staring from under the tangle, fixed,
strangely dark, strangely bright, as if their grief were
both a shadow and an illumination.</p>

<p>She herself ran back on her self-inflicted errand, all
her being merged into the one pain of knowing that in
ten minutes she would have turned a jogging peace to
bitterness, and bankrupted her mother’s life of its chief
treasure. She saw herself as a flame leaping from one
burning house to set another light.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup’s reception of the news held both the
expected and the unexpected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“I knew it,” she said stonily—“I felt it—I felt it in
my boans. And I toald him, too—I told him, poor soul,
as he’d never come back, and now he’ll never come,
surelye.” Then she said suddenly—“I mun go to her.”</p>

<p>“Go to whom, mother dear?”</p>

<p>“Thyrza. He’d want it ... and reckon she feels it
even wuss than me.”</p>

<p>Nothing could dissuade her, and off she went, to
comfort the woman with whom she had so long played
tug-of-war for her son.</p>

<p>Nell stayed behind in the dreary house, where it seemed
as if things slunk and crept. It was holiday-time, so
Zacky was at home, sobbing in a corner of the haystack,
crying on and on monotonously till he scarcely knew what
he cried for, then suddenly charmed out of his grief by a
big rat that popped out of the straw and ran across his
legs. Elphick and Juglery mumbled and grumbled together
in the barn, and talked of the shame of a yeoman
dying out of his bed, and cast deprecating eyes on the
indecency of Harry, dark against the sky on the ribbed
swell of the Street field, making his late sowings with
the new boy at his heels. Up and down the furrows went
Harry, with his head hung low, in his ears the mutter of
the guns, so faint on the windless April noon that he
sometimes thought they were just the sorrowful beating
of his own heart—up and down, scattering seed into the
earth, leaving his token of life in the fields he loved before
he was himself taken up and cast, vital and insignificant
as a seed, into the furrows of Aceldama or the
Field of Blood....</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup sat crouched over the fire, the tears every
now and then welling up in his eyes, and sometimes overflowing
on his cheeks, whence he wiped them away with
the back of his hand. “’Tis enough to maake a man
taake to drink,” he muttered to himself—“this is wot

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>

drives men to drink, surelye.” Every now and then he
looked up at the clock.</p>

<p>The clock struck twelve, and the Rifle Volunteer called
over the fields:</p>

<p>“Come, farmer, and have a pot with me. You’ve lost
a son in your War—there were no sons lost in mine, but
pots of beer are good for joy or sorrow. Come and
forget that boy for five minutes, how he looked and what
he said to you, forget this War through which good yeomen
die out of their beds, and drink with the Volunteer,
who drilled and marched and camped and did every other
warlike thing save fighting, and died between his sheets.”</p>

<p>Mus’ Beatup groped for his stick. Then he shook his
head rather sadly. “The boy’s scarce cold in his grave.
Reckon I mun wait a day or two before I disremember
his last words to me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup did not come home till after supper, and
went to bed almost at once. She felt fagged and tottery,
and there was a shrivelled, fallen look about her face.
When she was in bed, she could not sleep, but lay watching
the moon travel across the room, lighting first the
mirror, then the wall, then her own head, then maaster’s,
then climbing away up the chimney like a ghost. Every
now and then she fell into a little, light dose, so thridden
with dreams that it was scarcely sleeping.</p>

<p>In these dreams Tom was always a child, in her arms,
or at her feet, or spannelling about after the manner of
small boys with tops and string. She did not dream of
him as grown, and this was the basis of her new agreement
with Thyrza. Thyrza could never think of him
as a child, for she had never seen him younger than
eighteen; all her memories were concentrated in his few
short years of manhood, and his childhood belonged to
his mother. So his mother and his wife divided his
memory up between them, and each thought she had the
better part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup wondered if anyone—Bill Putland or
Mus’ Archie—would write and tell her about Tom’s end.
So far she had no idea how he had died, and her imagination
crept tearfully round him, asking little piteous questions
of the darkness—Had he suffered much? Had he
asked for her? Had he wanted her?—Oh, reckon he had
wanted her, and she had not been there, she had not
known that he was dying, she had been pottering round
after her household, cooking and washing up and sweeping
and dusting, and thinking of him as alive and well,
while all the time he was perhaps crying out for her in
the mud of No Man’s Land....</p>

<p>The tears rolled down her cheeks in the darkness that
followed the setting of the moon. Was it for this that
she had borne him in hope and anguish?—that he should
die alone, away from her, like a dog, in the mud?...
She saw the mud, he had so often told her of it, she saw
it sucking and oozing round him like the mud outside the
cowhouse door; she saw the milky puddles ... she saw
them grow dark and streaked with blood. Then, just as
her heart was breaking, she pictured him in the bare clean
ward of a hospital, as she had seen him at Eastbourne,
with a kind nurse to relieve his last pain and take down
his last little messages. Oh, someone was sure to write
to Tom’s mother and tell her how he had died, and perhaps
send her a message from him.</p>

<p>The daylight crept into the room, stabbing like a finger
under the blind, and with it her restlessness increased.
Then a pool of sunshine gleamed at the side of the bed.
She felt that she could not lie any longer, so climbed
out slowly from under the blankets. She tried not to
disturb her husband, but she was too unwieldy for a
noiseless rising, and she heard him turn over and mutter,
asking her what she meant by “waaking a man to his
trouble”—then falling asleep again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>She went down to the kitchen, to find Harry, his eyes
big and blurred with sleep, just going to set about his
business in the yard. Moved by a quake of tenderness
for this surviving son, she made him a cup of cocoa, and
insisted on his drinking it before he went out to work.
Then she did her own scrubbing with more care than
usual—“Reckon we must kip the farm up, now he’s
agone.” Urged by the same thought she went out to
the Dutch barn and mixed the chicken food, then opened
the hen-houses, feeling in the warm nests for eggs.</p>

<p>By now the sun was high, a big blazing pan slopping
fire over the roofs and into the ponds. The air was
full of sounds—crowings, cacklings, cluckings, the scurry
of fowls, the stamping of horses, and then the whining
hiss of milk into zinc pails. Hoofs thudded in the lane,
the call of a girl came from a distant field, all the country
of the Four Roads was waking to life and work, faltering
no more than light and darkness because one of its sons
had died for the fields he used to plough. Wheels
crunched in the drive, and then came the postman’s knock.
Mrs. Beatup put down her trug of meal, and waddled off
towards the house ... perhaps a letter had come about
Tom; it was rather early yet, still, perhaps it had come.</p>

<p>But Harry had already been to the door, and shook his
head when she asked if there was anything for her.</p>

<p>“Thur’s naun.”</p>

<p>“Naun fur none of us?”</p>

<p>“Only fur me.”</p>

<p>She saw that he was carrying a long, official-looking
envelope, and that his hand was clenched round it, as if
he held a knife.</p>

<p>“Wot’s that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“My calling-up paapers.”</p>


<h3>3</h3>

<p>Tom was not the only local casualty that week.
Bourner heard of the death of his eldest son, a youth
who had somehow squeezed himself out to the front at
the age of seventeen; the baker at Bodle Street lost his
lad, Stacey Collbran of Satanstown had died of wounds,
and the late postman at Brownbread Street was reported
missing. All these had been struck down together on
the ravaged hills round Wytschaete, where the Eighteenth
Sussex had for long hours held a trench which the
German guns had pounded to a furrow. In this furrow
the body of Tom Beatup lay with the bodies of other
Sussex chaps, hostages to shattered Flanders earth for
the inviolate Sussex fields.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatup heard about it from Mus’ Archie, who
wrote, as she had expected, while Bill Putland wrote to
Thyrza. Tom had been shot through the head. His
death must have been painless and instantaneous, the
Lieutenant told his mother. Then he went on to say how
much they had all liked Tom in the platoon, how popular
he had been with the men and how the officers had appreciated
his unfailing good-humour and reliableness. “All
soldiers grumble, as you probably know, but I never met
one who grumbled less than Beatup; and you could
always depend on him to do what was wanted. We shall
all miss him more than I can say, but he died bravely in
open battle, and we all feel very proud of him.”</p>

<p>“Proud”—that was the word they were all throwing
at her now: Mus’ Archie, the curate, even the minister.
They said, “You must be very proud of Tom,” just as
if all the age-old instincts of her breed did not generate
a feeling of shame for one who died out of his bed. Good
yeomen died between their sheets, and her son had died
out in the mud, like a sheep or a dog—and yet she must
be proud of him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Thyrza was proud—she said as much between her
tears. She said that Tom had died like a hero, fighting
for his wife and his child.</p>

<p>“He died for England,” said Mr. Poullett-Smith.</p>

<p>“He died for Sunday Street,” said the Rev. Mr. Sumption.
“I reckon that as his eyestrings cracked he saw the
corner by the Forge and the oasts of Egypt Farm.”</p>

<p>It appeared that Tom had died for a great many things,
but in her heart Mrs. Beatup guessed that it was really
a very little thing that he had died for—</p>

<p>“Reckon all he saw then wur our faaces,” she said to
herself.</p>

<p>As there had been so many local deaths, both now and
during the winter, it struck the curate to hold a memorial
service in the church at Brownbread Street. He knew
how the absence of a funeral, of any possibility of paying
mortuary honour to the loved ones, would add to the grief
of those left behind. So he hastily summoned a protesting
and bewildered choir to practise <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Æterna Christi
Munera</i>, and announced a requiem for the following
Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption saw in this one more attempt of the
church to “get the pull over him,” and resolved to contest
the advantage. He too would have a memorial
service, conducted on godly Calvinistic lines; there should
be no Popish prayers for the dead or vain confidence in
their eternal welfare, just a sober recollection before God
and preparation for judgment.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a tacit confession of weakness that Mr.
Sumption did not offer this attraction as a rival to the
Church service, but planned to have it later in the same
day, so that those with a funeral appetite could attend
both. Experience had taught him that what he had to
depend on was not so much his flock’s conviction as their
lack of conviction. The Particular Baptists in Sunday

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>

Street, those, that is to say, who for conscience’ sake
would never worship outside the Bethel, would not fill
two pews. He depended for the rest of his congregation
on the straying sheep of Ecclesia Anglicana, of the Wesleyans,
Primitive Methodists, Ebenezers, Bible Christians,
Congregationalists, and other sects that stuck tin roofs
about the parish fields.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that perhaps now was his great
chance to scatter the rival shepherds, so made his preparations
with elaborate care, boldly facing the handicaps
his conscience imposed by forbidding him to use decorations,
anthems, or instrumental music. He even had a
few handbills printed at his own expense, and canvassed a
hopeful popularity by rightly diagnosing the complaint
of some sick ewes belonging to Mus’ Putland.</p>


<h3>4</h3>

<p>On Thursday evening he sat in his room at the Horselunges,
preparing his sermon. Of course his sermons
were not written, but he took great pains with their
preparation under heads and points. He felt that this
occasion demanded a special effort, and it was unfortunate
that he felt all muddled and crooked, his thoughts
continually springing away from their discipline of
heads and racing off on queer adventures, scarcely agreeable
to Calvinistic theology.</p>

<p>He thought of those dead boys, some of whom he knew
well and others whom he knew but slightly, and he pictured
them made perfect by suffering, buying themselves
the Kingdom of Heaven by their blood. He knew that
his creed gave him no right to do so—Christ died for the
elect, and no man can squeeze his way into salvation by
wounds and blood. And yet these boys were crucified
with Christ.... He saw all the crosses of Flanders, a
million graves.... Perhaps there was a back way to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>

the Kingdom, a path of pain and sacrifice by which sinners
won the gate....</p>

<p>He rebuked himself, and bent again to his work. The
setting sun poured in from the west, making the little
room, with its faded, peeling walls, and mangy furniture,
a tub of swimming light. Mr. Sumption had got down
to his Fourthly when his thoughts went off again, and
this time after a boy who was not dead. It was a couple
of months since he had heard from Jerry, and the letter
had been unsatisfactory, though by this time he should
have learned not to expect so much from Jerry’s letters.
He lifted his head from the paper with a sigh, and, chin
propped on hand, gazed out of the window to where bars
of heavy crimson cloud reefed the blue bay of light. He
remembered an evening nearly a year ago, when he and
Jerry had sat by the window of a poor lodging-house
room in Kemp Town, and felt nearer to each other than
before in their lives....</p>

<p>“Reckon he can’t help it—reckon he’s just a vessel of
wrath.”</p>

<p>He bit his tongue as a cure for weakness, and for
another ten minutes bobbed and fumed over his notes.
The sermon was not going well. He had taken for his
text: “Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for
the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand; a
day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and
of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains.”
He told the congregation that their grief for
the death of these young men was but part of the universal
woe, a spark of that furnace which should devour
the world. Melting together in Doomsday fires the Book
of Revelation and the Minor Prophets, he pointed out
how the Scriptures had been fulfilled ... the Beast,
the False Prophet, the Army from the North, the Star
called Wormwood, the Woman on Seven Hills, the Vision

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>

of Four Horns, the Crowns of Joshua, the Flying Roll,
all these were in the world to-day, Signs in the rolling
clouds of smoke that poured from the burning fiery furnace,
where only the Children of God could walk unharmed.
“And the Sign of the Son of Man shall be
in the heavens....”</p>

<p>Here it was that again his thoughts became treacherous
to his theme. Instead of the Sign of the Son of
Man appearing in the heavens, he seemed to see it rising
out of the earth, the crosses on the million graves of
Flanders. Could it be that Christ was already come?
... come in the brave and patient sufferings of boys,
who died that the world might live?... “It is expedient
that one man should die for the people.” He drove away
the thought as a blasphemy, and stooped once more to his
paper, while his finger rubbed under the lines of his big
Bible beside him.</p>

<p>“Sixthly: The Crowns of Joshua. Satan at his right
hand. ‘The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan.’ The promise
of the Branch. The promise of the Temple. But all
must first be utterly destroyed. ‘I will utterly consume
all things, saith the Lord.’ Don’t think the War will end
before everything is destroyed. ‘That day is a day of
wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness
and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day
of clouds and thick darkness.’ The hope of the Elect.
’I will bring the third part through fire.’ ...”</p>

<p>There was the rattle and jar of crockery outside the
door, and the next minute Mrs. Hubble kicked it open,
and brought in the minister’s supper of bread and cocoa.
She set it down, ruthlessly sweeping aside his books and
paper, and then took a telegram out of her apron pocket.</p>

<p>“This has just come, and the girl’s waiting for an
answer.”</p>

<p>Telegrams came only on one errand in the country of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>

the Four Roads, and Mrs. Hubble felt sure that this was
to announce either the wounds or death of Jerry. It is
true that he might be coming home on leave, but in that
case she reckoned he would never trouble to send a telegram—he
would just turn up, and give her his room to
sweep and his bed to make all on the minute.</p>

<p>She narrowly watched the minister as he read it—if it
brought bad news she would like to be able to give the
village a detailed account of his reception of it. But he
made no sign—only struck her for the first time as looking
rather stupid. It was queer that she had never
noticed before what a heavy, blunted kind of face he
had.</p>

<p>“Any answer?”</p>

<p>He shook his head, and put the telegram face downwards
on the tray. Mrs. Hubble flounced out and banged
the door.</p>

<p>For some minutes after she had gone Mr. Sumption
sat motionless, his arm dangling at his sides, his eyes fixed
rather vacantly on the steam rising from the cocoa-jug.
The sun had dipped behind the meadow-hills of Bird-in-Eye,
and only a few red, fiery rays glowed on the ceiling.
Mr. Sumption picked up the telegram and read it
again.</p>

<p>“Deeply regret to inform you that Private J. M.
Sumption has died at the front.”</p>

<p>He felt weak, boneless, as if his joints had been smitten
asunder. Something hot and heavy seemed to press down
his skull. He could not think, and yet the inhibition was
not a respite, but a torment. His ears sang. Every now
and then he tried pitifully to collect himself, but failed.
Jerry dead ... Jerry dead ... then suddenly his head
fell forward on his hands, and he began to cry, first
weakly, then stormily, noisily, his whole body shaking.</p>

<p>The sobs stopped as suddenly as they had begun, but

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>

the brain-pressure had been relieved, and he could now
think a little. He saw, as from a great way off, himself
before the telegram came—he saw that as he planned
that memorial service, prepared that elegiac sermon, there
had run in his veins a fiery, subtle pride that he, at least,
was father of a living man. He had not seen it at the
time, but he saw it now—now that his pride had been
trampled and he himself was in the same abyss with the
souls he was to comfort. He too was father of the
dead; Jerry was dead—at last and for ever beyond the
reach of his help, his efforts, even his prayers ... the
son of the woman from Ihornden.</p>

<p>The room was almost in darkness now; fiery lights
moved and shifted, and by their glow he read the telegram
over again, for at the bottom of his heart was
always a sick, insane thought that he must be mistaken,
that this blow could not have fallen, that Jerry must still
be somewhere alive and up to no good. But the message
was there, and now on this third reading, he noticed
something peculiar about the phrasing of it—“Private
Sumption has died at the front.” Surely this was not the
usual form of announcement. He had seen several such
messages of woe, and they had read “killed in action”
or “died of wounds.” He had never seen one put exactly
like this.</p>

<p>However, it was not of any real importance. Jerry was
dead; that was the only vital, necessary fact. But he
would write to Mus’ Archie for particulars.... The
lamp was on the table, and he lit it, pushing aside the
unused supper-tray and the littered sermon-paper.</p>


<h3>5</h3>

<p>He wrote on into the night. He found a certain
crookedness in his ideas which made him tear up several

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>

efforts—he once even found himself writing to Jerry,
a proceeding which struck him with peculiar horror.
The hours ticked on; the big constellations swung
solemnly across the uncurtained window (luckily Policeman
was in bed, and did not see the lozenge of gold lamplight
that lay in Mrs. Hubble’s backyard). Inside the
room the cat prowled to and fro, miaowling to be let out
for a scamper on the barn-roofs—at last, he jumped on
the table and, upsetting the cocoa, lapped his fill and
retired to dignified repose. The mice tapped on the glass
front of their cage with little pink hands like anemones....
Mr. Sumption for once did not notice his animals;
he sat brooding over the table long after he had finished
writing. Then, as the sky was fading into light, and big
greyish-white clouds like mushrooms were banking
towards the east, he dropped asleep, his head fallen over
the back of his chair, with the mouth a little open, his
arms hanging at his sides.</p>

<p>The daylight fought with the lamplight, and as with
a sudden crimson rift it won the victory, Mr. Sumption
woke—from dreams full of the roaring of a forge and his
own arm swung above his head, as in the old days at
Bethersden. He sat for a few moments rubbing his eyes,
feeling very stiff and cold. Then he realised that he was
hungry. The supper-tray was still before him, swimming
in cocoa. He ate the bread—dry, because the minister
was one of those greedy souls who devour their week’s
ration of butter in the first three days, and neither jam
nor cheese was to be had in Sunday Street, even if he
could have afforded them. When he had eaten all the
bread, he began to feel thirsty. He longed for a cup of
tea. Overhead in the attic there was a trampling, which
told him that Mrs. Hubble would soon be down to boil
the kettle. He hung about the stairhead till she appeared—shouting
back at her father-in-law, who would not get

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>

up, and generally in a bad mood for her lodger’s service.</p>

<p>However, to his surprise, she was quite obliging—he
did not know what his night had made of him. She
hurried down to the kitchen to light the fire, and bade
him come too and warm himself. Mr. Sumption would
have preferred to be alone, but he was beginning to feel
very cold, and a kind of weakness was upon him, so he
came and sat by her fire, and drank gratefully the big,
strong cup of tea she gave him.</p>

<p>“You’ve had bad news of Mus’ Jerry, I reckon,”
said Mrs. Hubble.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption nodded, and warmed his hands round
the cup. He could not bring himself to say that Jerry
was dead.</p>

<p>“This is a tar’ble war,” continued Mrs. Hubble, “and
I reckon those are best off wot are put out of it”—this
was to find out what really had happened to Jerry. “I
often think,” she added piously, “of the happy lot of the
dead—no more trouble, no more pain, no more worriting
after absent friends, no more standing in queues. I often
think, minister, as it’s a pity we aun’t all dead.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, maybe,” said Mr. Sumption.</p>

<p>He rose and walked restlessly out of the kitchen. He
both wanted companionship and yet could not bear it.
When would the day end—the day that streamed and
blew and shone over Jerry’s grave?... He was going
upstairs, when he heard a shuffle of paper behind him,
and saw that a letter had been pushed under the door.
The post came early to Sunday Street, and Mr. Sumption
ran down again, full of an eager, futile hope. The letter
bore the familiar field postmark, and at first he thought
it was from Jerry, and that he was going to suffer that
rending, ecstatic agony of reading letters from the dead.
But as he picked it up he saw that the writing was not
Jerry’s, but in a hand he did not know. Whose could it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>

be?—whosoever it was must be writing about his son.
He tore it open as he went up to his room, and at the
bottom of the folded paper saw, “Yours, with sincerest
sympathy, Archibald Lamb.”</p>

<p>Of course, it was Mr. Archie—writing to Jerry’s father
as he had written to Tom’s mother. The minister had
had very little to do with the Squire, except on one
occasion, when he had met him riding home from a day’s
hunting, on a badly-lamed horse, and had applied a
fomentation which Mr. Archie said had worked a wonderful
cure. Now there were two pages covered with
his big, firm handwriting. Mr. Sumption pulled them out
of the envelope, and from between them a grimy piece of
paper fell to the ground, scrawled over with the familiar
smudge of indelible pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption grabbed it, letting Mr. Archie’s letter
fall in its stead. As he began to read it, he wondered if
it had been found on Jerry’s body—it was certainly more
smeary and stained than usual. After he had read a
little, he sat down in his chair. His hand shook, and he
stooped his head nearer and nearer to the writing as if
his sight were failing him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Father</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>“By the time you get this I will be out of the way
of troubling you any more. I am in great trouble. Mr.
Archie said perhaps not tell you, but I said I would
rather you knew. It is like this. I kept away in ——
last time we went up to the trenches, with a lady friend,
you may have heard of. Beatup says he told you. Well,
I am to be shot for it. I was court-martialled, and they
said to be shot. Dear Father, this will make you very
sorry, but it cannot be helped, and I am not worth it.
I have been a very bad son to you, and done many wicked
things besides. Things always were against me. Mr.
Archie has been very kind, and so has the pardry here.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>

Mr. Archie is sitting with me to-night, and he says he
will stay all night, as I am feeling very much upset at
this great trouble. I am leaving you my ring made out
of a piece of Zep and my purse, only I am afraid there
is no money in it. Please remember me to Ivy Beatup,
and say if it had not been for her I should not be here
now. I think that is all.</p>

<p class="sig40">
“Ever your loving son,</p>

<p class="sig4">“<span class="smcap">Jeremiah Meridian Sumption</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p>“P.S.—The pardry says Jesus will forgive my sins.
Thank you very much, dear father, for those fags you
sent. I am smoking one now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>It was nearly half an hour later that Mr. Sumption
picked up Archie Lamb’s letter. It caught his eye at
last as he stared at the floor, and he picked it up and
unfolded it. Perhaps it would give him a grain of
comfort.</p>

<p>The lieutenant afterwards described it as the most
sickening job he had ever had in his life. The usual
letter of condolence and explanation, such as he had over
and over again written to parents and wives, became an
easy task compared with this. Here he had to deal not
only with sorrow, but with disgrace. He could not write,
as he had so often written, “We are proud of him.”
He could not refer back with congratulations to a good
record—Jerry had died as he had lived, a bad soldier, a
disgrace to the uniform he wore, and there seemed very
little that could be decently said about him.</p>

<p>However, the innate kind-heartedness and good feeling
of the young officer pulled him successfully through an
ordeal that would have staggered many better wits. He

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>

began by explaining his reluctance, and that he was writing
only because Jerry wished it—though, perhaps, it
was better, after all, that his father should know the
truth. “As a matter of fact, it is not so dreadful as it
sounds. Your son is not to die so much as a punishment
as a warning. The shooting of deserters is chiefly a
deterrent—and your son is dying so that other men may
be warned by his fate to stick to the ranks and do their
duty as soldiers; therefore you may say that, indirectly,
he is dying for his country. Moreover, his disappearance
was not due to cowardice, but to other reasons which you
probably know of. I don’t know if this mitigates it to
you, it certainly does to me. Sumption is not a coward.
I have seen him in action, and I repeat that he is as
plucky as any one.</p>

<p>“I am sitting with him now, and I want to make your
mind easy about the end. When I have finished writing
this he will be given his supper, food and a hot drink.
Then he will go to sleep. He will be roused just ten
minutes before the time, and hurried off, still half-asleep—he
will never be quite awake. There will be no awful
apprehension and agony, such as I expect you imagine—please
don’t worry about that.</p>

<p>“I have not been able to get him a padre of his own
church, but a very good Congregational man has been
with him, and has, of course, respected your convictions
in every way.</p>

<p>“Now before I end up, I want to say again that it
isn’t really as bad as it looks—the disgrace, I mean.
Think of your son as having died so that other men
should take warning by him and not desert the ranks,
and therefore, in that sense he has died for his country.”</p>

<p>Then Archie Lamb asked Mr. Sumption to write to
him if there was anything more he wanted to know, and
said that he would forward Jerry’s purse and ring at the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>

first opportunity. After the signature was added: “It
is all over now, and happened as I told you. He was still
half asleep, and suffered practically nothing.”</p>


<h3>7</h3>

<p>For some minutes Mr. Sumption sat with his head
buried in his hands. Before his closed eyes he saw pass
the last pitiful act of Jerry’s tragedy. He saw him standing
defiant and furtive—he would always look defiant
and furtive, even if half awake—with his back to the
wall ... then—cr-r-rack!—and he would fall down at
the foot of it in a crumpled heap, that perhaps still moved
a little.... But he had suffered nothing ... practically
nothing....</p>

<p>Then he saw Jerry standing all his life with his back
to a wall, every man armed against him. He had but
died as he had lived. Even his own father had been
against him, had misused and misunderstood him. There
had never been anyone to understand that mysterious,
troubled heart, anyone who could have understood it—except,
perhaps, Meridian Hearn, his mother—and that
queer people of defiant furtive ways, whose dark blood
had run in his veins and been his ruin. Meridian Hearn
should not have married the <i>gaujo</i> preacher from Bethersden—she
should have married one of her own race,
and then her child would have lived among those of like
passions as he, and not among strangers, who had mobbed
him and pecked his eyes out, like sparrows attacking a
foreign bird.</p>

<p>“Oh, Meridian, Meridian!—our boy’s dead....”</p>

<p>There was the familiar clatter and kick outside the
door, and Mrs. Hubble came in with the breakfast tray.
Her face was crimson and very much excited, though she
tried to work it into lines of woe; for she had at last

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>

heard the news about Jerry, from Gwen Bourner, who
had heard it from Mrs. Bill Putland, who had had a
letter from her husband that morning. All Sunday
Street now knew that Jerry Sumption had been shot as
a deserter, having given the 18th Sussex the slip on the
eve of the action in which Tom Beatup and Fred Bourner
and Stacey Collbran and other local boys had given up
their limbs and lives—he had gone to a French woman,
and been found in a blouse and wooden shoes. The
platoon would not miss him much, Bill Putland said;
but he was unaccountable sorry for his father.</p>

<p>So, to do her justice, was Mrs. Hubble. She had put
an extra spoonful of tea in his tea-pot, and had boiled
him an egg, a luxury which was not included in his boarding
fees. Moreover, she gave him a pitying glance, as
she swept the litter of sermon-paper to one side.</p>

<p>“Will you want me to tell people?” she asked him.</p>

<p>“Tell people what?” His voice came throatily, like
an old man’s.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you woan’t be preaching to-night?”</p>

<p>Something in her voice made him start up, and pull
himself together. He saw her squinting compassionately
at him, with the corner of her apron in readiness.</p>

<p>“Preach!—Why do you ask that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about your loss. I reckon you woan’t be
feeling in heart for preaching.”</p>

<p>He did not reply.</p>

<p>“I cud easy stick up a notice on the chapel door,”
she continued, “and all the folkses hereabouts ud understand.
They’d never expect you to spik after wot’s
happened.”</p>

<p>“Woman!—what has happened?”</p>

<p>He spoke so suddenly and so loudly, that Mrs. Hubble
started, and dropped the corner of her apron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I ... well, we’ve all of us heard, Mus’ Sumption....”</p>

<p>“Heard what?”</p>

<p>“I—I.... Doan’t look at me like that, minister, for
the Lord’s sake.”</p>

<p>“Speak then. What have you all heard?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hubble was recovering from her alarm and beginning
to resent his manner.</p>

<p>“Well, reckon we’ve heard wot you’ve heard—as your
boy’s bin shot fur deserting his regiment; and no one
expects you to come and preach in chapel after that.”</p>

<p>A wave of burning crimson went over Mr. Sumption’s
face, so that Mrs. Hubble said afterwards she thought as
he’d go off in a stroke. Then he was suddenly white
again, and speaking quietly, but in a voice that somehow
frightened her more than his shouting.</p>

<p>“I shall certainly preach to-night. I will not have the
service cancelled. Tell everyone who asks you that I shall
certainly preach.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir.”</p>

<p>She edged towards the door.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Hubble! Stop a moment. Say this, too. I
am not ashamed of my son. I reckon you all think I am
ashamed of him, and you are putting your heads together
and clacking, and pitying me for it. But I am not
ashamed. He died for England. Mr. Archie himself
says it. These are his very words: Wait!”—for Mrs.
Hubble was going to bolt.</p>

<p>“I’m waiting, Mus’ Sumption.”</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Think of your son as having died so that
other men should take warning by him and not desert
the ranks, and, therefore, in that sense he has died for
his country.’ Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then you can go.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Hubble fled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>


<h3>8</h3>

<p>All that morning heavy pacings over her head convinced
Mrs. Hubble that the minister was preparing a
wonderful sermon. She generally guessed the temper of
his discourse by the weight and width of the stumpings
which preceded it. To-day she could hear him, as she
expressed it, all over the room ... he was kicking the
fire-irons ... he had overturned his chair ... he had
flung up the window and banged it down again. Obviously
something great was in process, and at the same
time she felt that Mr. Sumption was rather mad. It
was nothing short of indecent for him to preach to-night,
after what had happened—and the queer way he had
spoken about Jerry, too....</p>

<p>By this time the whole of Sunday Street knew about
Jerry. He was discussed at breakfast-tables, in barns,
on doorsteps, on milking-stools. No one was surprised;
indeed, most people seemed to have foretold his bad end.
“I said as he’d come to no good, that gipsy’s brat.”</p>

<p>“A valiant minister wot can’t breed up his own son.”
“Howsumdever, I’m middling sorry fur the poor chap; I’ll never
disremember how he saaved that cow of mine wot wur dying of
garget.” “And I’m hemmed, maaster, if he wurn’t better wud my
lambing ewes than my own looker, surelye.”</p>

<p>On the whole, the news improved his chances of a congregation.
It was a better advertisement than the notice
on the church door, or even than his veterinary achievement
at Egypt Farm. Some “wanted to see how he took
it,” others openly admired his pluck; all were stirred by
curiosity and also by compassion. During the years he
had lived among them he had grown dear to them and
rather contemptible. They looked down on him for his
shabbiness, his poverty, his pastoral blundering, his lack

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>

of education; but they liked him for his willingness, his
simplicity, his sturdy good looks, his strong muscles, his
knowledge of cattle and horses.</p>

<p>All that morning people wavered up the street towards
the Horselunges, and looked at it, and at the Bethel.
Sometimes they gathered together in little groups, but
always some way off. The Bethel stared blindly over
the roof of the Horselunges, as if it ignored the misery
huddled at its doors. No matter what might be the private
sorrows of its servant, he must come to-night and
preach within its walls those iron doctrines of Doomsday
and Damnation in whose honour it had been built and
had stood staring over the fields with the blind eyes of a
corpse for a hundred years.</p>

<p>Towards noon Thyrza Beatup came up the street,
walking briskly, with her weeds flapping behind her. It
was the first time she had been out since her widowing,
and people stared at her from their doors as she walked
boldly up to Horselunges and knocked.</p>

<p>“How is poor Mus’ Sumption?” she asked Mrs.
Hubble.</p>

<p>“Lamentaable, lamentaable,” said Mrs. Hubble, with
eye and apron in conjunction.</p>

<p>“Well, please tell him as Mrs. Tom Beatup sends her
kind remembrances and sympathy, and she reckons she
knows wot he feels, feeling the saum herself.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Mrs. Beatup.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll be sure and give it all wot I said—about
feeling the saum myself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sartain.”</p>

<p>Thyrza walked off. Her face was very white and
wooden. Mrs. Hubble stared after her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“Middling pretty as golden-haired women look in them
weeds.... Feels the saum as Mus’ Sumption, does she?
That’s queer, seeing as Tom died lik Onward Christian
Soldiers, and Jerry lik a dog. Howsumdever, I mun give
her words ... maybe he’ll be fool enough to believe
them.”</p>

<p>The day was warm and misty, without much sun. The
sky above the woods was yellowish, like milk, and the air
smelt of rain. But the rain did not come till evening.
Mr. Poullett-Smith’s congregation assembled dry, and
nobody’s black was spoiled on the way home. In spite
of this, the service was not thickly attended. The advertisement
which Jerry Sumption’s death had given the
Bethel made those who had time or inclination for only
one church-going decide to put it off until the evening.
Only a few assembled to hear the curate pray that the
souls they commemorated—among which he was not
afraid to include Jerry—might be brought by Saint
Michael, the standard-bearer, into the holy light.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Bethel was crowded, and by
this time it was raining hard. The air was thick with the
steaming of damp clothes. The lamps shuddered and
smoked in the draught of the rising wind, and the big,
blinded windows were running down with rain, as if they
wept for the destruction of the chapel weed....</p>

<p>Never had the Rev. Mr. Sumption such a congregation.
Nearly the whole of Sunday Street jostled in the pews.
Instead of the meagre peppering of heads, there were
tight rows of them, like peas in pods. All the Beatups
were there, except Nell, who had stayed at home to look
after the house; even Mus’ Beatup had hobbled over on
his stick. The Putlands were there, and Mrs. Bill Putland,
and the Sindens and the Bourners and the Hubbles.
Thyrza had come, with little Will asleep in her arms—she
sat near the back, in case she should have to take him out.
The Hollowbones had come from the Foul Mile and the
Kadwells from Stilliands Tower; there were Collbrans
from Satanstown, Viners from Puddledock, Ades from

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>

Bodle Street, and even stragglers from Brownbread
Street and Dallington. Most of them had never been in
the Bethel before, and it struck them as unaccountable
mean, with its smoking lamps and windows flapping with
dingy blinds, its pews that smelled of wood-rot, and its
walls all peeled and scarred with moisture and decay.</p>

<p>There was a rustle and scrape as Mr. Sumption came
in, through the little door behind the pulpit. Then there
was silence as he stood looking down, apparently unmoved,
on what must have been to him an extraordinary
sight—his church crowded, full to the doors, as he had
so often dreamed, but never seen. He looked pale and
languid, and his eyes were like smoky lanterns. His voice
also seemed to have lost its ring as he gave out the number
of the psalm, and then in the prayer which followed it.
Moreover, though the congregation, being mostly new,
shuffled and kicked its heels disgracefully, he thumped at
no one.</p>

<p>“Pore soul, he shudn’t ought to have tried it,” thought
Thyrza to herself in her corner. “He’ll never get
through.”</p>

<p>After the prayer, which was astonishingly nerveless for
a prayer of Mr. Sumption’s, came a hymn, during which
the minister sat in the pulpit, his hand over his face.
Those in the front rows saw his jaws work as if he was
praying. People whispered behind their Bibles—“He’s
different, surelye—just lik a Church parson to-night.”
“Reckon it’s changed him—knocked all the beans out of
him, as you might say.” “Pore chap, he looks middling
tired—reckon he finds this a tar’ble job.”</p>

<p>Then the singing stopped, and Mr. Sumption stood up,
wearily turning over the leaves of his big Bible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“Brethren, you will find my text in the Eleventh of
John, the fiftieth verse: ‘It is expedient that one man
should die for the people.’”</p>


<p>9</p>

<p>The sermon began with the unaccustomed flatness of
the rest of the service. Mr. Sumption’s voice had lost
its resonance, his arms no longer waved like windmill-sails,
nor did his joints crack like dried osiers. He made
his points languidly on his fingers, instead of thumping
them out on the pulpit with his fist. The congregation
would have been disappointed if they had not known
the reason for this slackness; as things were, it was part
of the spectacle. They noticed, too, a certain bitterness
that crept into his speech now and then, as when he
described the Chief Priests and Scribes plotting together
to take refuge behind the sacrifice of Christ. “It is
expedient for us ... that the whole nation perish not.”</p>

<p>“Brethren, I see them nodding their ugly beards together,
and saying: ‘Let this young man go and die for
us. One man must die for the people, and it shan’t be
one of us, I reckon—we’re too important, we can’t be
spared. Let us send this young man to his death. It is
expedient that he should die for the nation.’”</p>

<p>Then suddenly he stiffened his back, bringing his open
Bible together with a thud, while his voice rang out with
the old clearness:</p>

<p>“Reckon that was what you said among yourselves
when you saw the young men we’re thinking of to-night
go up before the Tribunal, or volunteer at the Recruiting
Office. You said to yourselves, ‘That’s right, that’s
proper. It is expedient that these young men should
go and die for the people. I like to see a young man
go to fight for his country. I’m too old.... I’ve got a
bad leg ... but I like to see the young men go.’”</p>

<p>For a moment he stood and glared at them, as in the
old days, his eyes like coals, his big teeth bared like a
fighting dog’s. Then once again his weariness dropped

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>

over him, his head hung, and his sentences ran together,
husky and indistinct.</p>

<p>The congregation shuffled and coughed. The service
required peppermint-sucking to help it through, and owing
to war conditions no peppermints were forthcoming.
Zacky Beatup made a rabbit out of his handkerchief and
slid it over the back of the pew at Lily Sinden. Mus’
Beatup began to calculate the odds against the Bethel
closing before the Rifle Volunteer. Old Mus’ Hollowbone
from the Foul Mile crossed his legs and went to
sleep, just as if he was sitting with the Wesleyans.
Then Maudie Sinden pulled a screw of paper out of her
pocket and extracted a piece of black gum—the very piece
she had taken out of her mouth on entering the chapel,
knowing that no sweet had ever been sucked there since
Tommy Bourner was bidden “spue forth that apple of
Sodom” two years ago. Thyrza had never seen a congregation
so demoralised, but then she had never seen a
minister so dull, so drony, so lack-lustre, so lifeless. “He
shudn’t ought to have tried it, poor chap,” she murmured
into the baby’s shawl.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Mr. Sumption’s fist came down on his
Bible. The pulpit lamps shuddered, and rattled their
glass shades, and the congregation started into postures
of attention, as the minister glared up and down the rows
of heads in the pod-like pews.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’ve no heart for the Gospel to-day,” he
said severely. “Pray the Lord to change your hearts,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>

as He changed my sermon. This is not the sermon I
had meant to preach to you, and if you don’t like it, it
is the Lord’s doing. I had for my text: ‘The day of
the Lord is at hand, as the morning spread upon the
mountains.’ That was my text, and I had meant to warn
you all of the coming of that day, as I have so often
warned you. It is a day which shall burn like an oven,
and the strong man shall cry therein mightily; it is a day
of darkness and gloominess, of clouds and thick darkness.
Then I was going forward to show you how the
Sign of the Son of Man shall be in the heavens, and how
He shall appear in clouds with great glory.... But the
Lord came then and smote me, and I lay as dead before
Him, like Moses in the Mount. And when I came to
myself, I knew that the Sign of the Son of Man is
already with us here—not in heaven, but on earth—rising
up out of the earth ... over there in France—the
crosses of the million Christs you have crucified.”</p>

<p>They were all listening now. He could see their craning,
attentive faces, and their kicks and coughs had died
down into a rather scandalised silence.</p>

<p>“The million Christs you have crucified, all those boys
you sent out to die for the people. You sent them in
millions to die for you and for your little children, and
their blood shall be on you and on your children. Oh,
you stiff-necked and uncircumcised—talking of Judgment
as if it was a great way off, and behold it is at your
doors; and the Christ Whom you look for has come suddenly
to His temple—in the suffering youth of this country—all
countries—in these boys who go out and suffer
and die and bleed, cheerfully, patiently, like sheep—that
the whole nation perish not.</p>

<p>“Think of the boys you have sent, the boys we’re
specially remembering here to-day. There was Tom
Beatup—a good honest lad, simple and clean as a little
child. He went out to fight for you, but I reckon you
never woke up in your comfortable bed and said:
’There’s poor Tom Beatup, up to the loins in mud, and
freezing with cold, and maybe as empty as a rusty pail.’
The thought of him never spoiled your night’s rest, and
you never felt, ‘I’ve got to struggle tooth and nail to be
worth his sacrificing himself like that for an old useless

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>

trug like me, and I’ll do my best to help my country at
home in any way as it can be done, so as the War ull
be shortened and Tom ull have a few nights less in the
mud.’ That’s what you ought to have said, but I reckon
you didn’t say it.</p>

<p>“There’s Stacey Collbran, too, who left a young
sweetheart, and ull never know the love of wedded life
because you had to be died for. Do you ever think of
him when your Wife lies in your bosom, and say, ‘Reckon
I’ll be good to my wife, since for my sake a poor chap
never had his’?</p>

<p>“And there’s Fred Bourner, and Sid Viner, and Joe
Kadwell, and Leslie Ades—they all went out to die for
you, and they died, and you come here to remember them
to-night; but in your hearts, which ought to be breaking
with reverence and gratitude, you’re just saying, ‘It’s
proper, it’s expedient that these men should die for the
people, that the whole nation perish not.’</p>

<p>“And there’s my boy....”</p>

<p>The minister’s voice hung paused for a minute. He
leaned over the pulpit, his hands gripping the wood till
their knuckles stood out white from the coarse brown.
His eyes travelled up and down the pew-pods of staring
heads, as if he expected to see contradiction or mockery
or surprise. But the Sunday Street face is not expressive,
and except for the utter stillness, Mr. Sumption might
have been reading the chapel accounts.</p>

<p>“There’s my boy, Jerry Sumption; Maybe you thought
I wouldn’t talk of him to-night, that I’d be ashamed, that
I’d never dare mention his name along of your gallant
boys. Besides, you say, What’s he got to do with it?
He never died for the people. But you thought wrong.
I’m not ashamed to speak his name along of Tom and
Stace and Fred and Sid and Joe, and he hasn’t got nothing
to do with it, either. For I tell you—<em>my boy died for</em>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>

<em>your boys</em>. He died as an example and warning to them,
to save them from a like fate, and if that isn’t dying for
them.... These are Mr. Archie Lamb’s very words:
’Your son is dying so that other men may be warned by
his fate and stick to the ranks and do their duty as soldiers;
therefore, in that sense he has died for his country.’
I reckon it seems a big thing to shoot a boy just
for going off to see his girl when the company’s marching;
but if it weren’t done then other boys ud stop away
and the regiment go to pieces. Mr. Archie and the other
officers said, ‘It is expedient that one man should die for
the regiment, that the whole army perish not.’...</p>

<p>“No! I am not ashamed of my boy! If he was led
astray at the last moment by his evil, human passions,
who shall judge him?—Not I, and not you. He did not
desert because he was a coward, because he funked the
battle before him. Listen again to Mr. Archie Lamb;
he says, ‘Sumption is not a coward—I have seen him
in action, and I repeat that he is as plucky as any one.’
And he joined up as a volunteer, too—he didn’t have to
be fetched, he didn’t go before the Tribunal and say he’d
got a bad leg, or a bad arm, and his father couldn’t run
the business without him. He joined up out of free-will
and love of his country. The Army was no place for
him, for his blood was the blood of the Rossarmescroes
or Hearns, which knows not obedience. When he joined
he risked his life not only at the hands of the enemy but
at the hands of his own countrymen, and it is his own
countrymen that have put him to death, ‘that the whole
nation perish not.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>“I tell you, my boy died for your boys; my boy died
for you, and you shall not look down on his sacrifice.
Over his grave is the Sign of the Son of Man, Who gave
His life as a ransom for many. To save your boys from
the possibility of a disgrace such as his my boy died in
shame. When they see the grave of Jerry Sumption they
will say: ‘That is the grave of a man who died because
he could not obey laws or control passions, because he
was not master of his own blood. Therefore let us take
heed by him and walk warily, and do our duty as soldiers;
and if we must die, not die as he died....’ So
my son died for your sons, and my son and your sons
died for you; and I ask you: ‘Are you worth dying
for?’”</p>

<p>Again the minister was silent, staring down at the
rows of wooden, expressionless faces, now faintly a-sweat
in the steam and heat of the Bethel. Then suddenly he
burst out at them, loudly, impatiently:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the truth about yourselves; I’ll tell you
if you’re worth dying for. What has this War meant to
you? What have you done for this War? There’s just
one answer to both questions. Nothing. While men were
fighting for their own and your existence, while they were
suffering horrors out there in France which you can’t
think of, and if you could think of could not speak of,
you were just muddling about there in your little ways,
thinking of nothing but crops and prices and the little silly
inconveniences you had to put up with. Ho! I reckon
you never thought of the War, except when you got some
cheery letter from your boy, telling you he was having the
time of his life out there, or when the price of bread
went up, or you had to eat margarine instead of butter,
or you couldn’t get your Sunday joint. All that war
meant to you was new orders about lights, and tribunals
taking your farm-hands, and prices going up and food
getting scarce, and the War Agricultural Committee leaving
Cultivation orders. And all the time you grumbled
and groused, and wrote out to your boys that you were
dying of want, weakening their hearts—they who wrote
you kind and cheery letters out of the gates of hell. You
stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You
little, little souls, that only bother about the little concerns
of your little parish in the middle of this great woe. The
end of the world is come, and you know it not; Christ
is dying for you and you heed Him not. Are you worth
dying for? Are you worth living for? No—you’re
scarce worth preaching at.”</p>

<p>By this time there were signs of animation among the
pea-pods. The peas rolled from side to side, and a faint
rustle of indignation came from them.</p>

<p>“I know why you’re here to-night,” continued Mr.

Sumption. “You’ve come to gaze on me, to watch me
in my trouble, to see how I take it. You haven’t come to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>

hear the Gospel—you yawned and wriggled all the time
I was preaching it. You haven’t come just to think of
the dead boys—you did that in church this morning.
You’re here to gaze at me, to see how I take it. Well,
now you see how I take it. You see I’m not ashamed.
Why should I be ashamed of my son? He’s worth a
bundle of you—he’s died a better death than anyone in
this church is likely to die; and if he lived a vessel of
wrath, at all events he was a full vessel, not just a jug
of emptiness. He lived like the wild man he was born,
and he died like a poor wild animal shot down. But I am
not ashamed of him. And though he died without baptism,
without conversion, without assurance, I cannot and
I will not believe that he is lost. Somewhere the love of
God is holding him. The Lord tells me that my fatherhood
is only a poor mess of His; well, in that case, I
reckon He won’t cast out my lad. Willingly I’d bear his
sins for him, and so I reckon Christ will bear them even
for the child of wrath. Where I can love, He can love
more, and since He died as a felon, reckon He feels for
my poor boy. He knows what it is to stand with His
back to the wall and see every man’s hand raised against
Him, and every man’s tongue stuck out. And because
He knows, He understands, and because He understands,
He forgives. Amen.”</p>

<p>The windows of the Bethel shook mournfully in the
wind, and the rain hissed down them, as if it shuddered
and wept to hear such doctrine within its walls. But
the sounds were lost in the shuffle of the rising congregation,
standing up to sing the psalm.</p>


<h3>10</h3>

<p>That night the minister did not stand at the door to
shake hands with the departing congregation. Beatups,
Putlands, Sindens, Hubbles, Bourners, jostled their way
unsaluted into the darkness, groping with umbrellas,
fumbling into cloaks. But even the rain could not prevent
an exchange of indignation. People formed themselves
into clumps and scurried together over the wet
road. From every clump voices rose in expostulation and
resentment.</p>

<p>“To think as I’d live to be insulted in church!”</p>

<p>“Reckon he’d never dare say half that in a plaace
whur folkses’ tongues wurn’t tied to answer him.”</p>

<p>“Maade out as we thought only of our insides,” said
Mrs. Sinden. “Seemingly he never thinks of his, when
all the village knows he wur trying the other day to
make Mrs. Tom give him a tin of salmon fur ninepence
instead of one-and-three.”</p>

<p>“And she did it, too,” said Mrs. Putland.</p>

<p>“It’s twice,” said Mrs. Beatup, “as he called me stiff-necked
and uncircumcised, and I reckon I aun’t neither.”</p>

<p>“And he said I wur lik an empty jug,” said Mus’
Beatup.</p>

<p>“And his Jerry’s worth a bundle of us,” laughed Mus’
Sinden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wot vrothers me,” wheezed old Father-in-law
Hubble, “is that to the best of my hearing I heard him
maake out as Christ died fur all.”</p>

<p>“And why shudn’t he?” asked Mus’ Putland.</p>

<p>“Because Mus’ Sumption’s paid seventy pound a year
to teach as Christ died for the Elect, and so he always
has done till to-night.”</p>

<p>“Well, seemingly thur wurn’t much Elect in gipsy
Jerry, so he had to change his mind about that. Reckon
he had to git Jerry saaved somehow.”</p>

<p>“But he’d no call to chaange the Divine council—I’ve
half a mind to write to the Assembly about it.”</p>

<p>“Wot sticks in my gizzard,” said Mus’ Bourner, “is
that to hear him you’d think as we’re all to blame for
Jerry’s going wrong, while I tell you it’s naun but his
own mismanaging and bad breeding-up of the boy.
’Bring up a child in the way he should go, and when he
is old he will not depart from it.’ That’s Bible, but it’s
sense too. It’s all very praaper for Minister to stick by
the young boy now and say he aun’t ashaumed of him,
but if only he’d brought him up Christian and not spoiled
him, reckon he’d never have bin called upon to stand thur
and say it.”</p>

<p>There were murmurs and assenting “Surelyes.”</p>

<p>“He spoiled that boy summat tar’ble,” continued the
smith. “Cudn’t say No to him, and let him have his
head justabout shocking. Then maybe he’d git angry
when the young chap had disgraced him, and hit him
about a bit. But thur aun’t no sense in that, nuther.
Wot Jerry wanted wur a firm, light hand and no whip—and
Mus’ Sumption ud have been the fust to see it if
Jerry had bin a horse.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s got his punishment now,” said Mrs. Putland.
“Poor soul, my heart bleeds for him.”</p>

<p>“Howsumdever, he’d no call to insult us,” said Mrs.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>

Sinden, “and I fur one ull never set foot agaun in that
Bethel as long as I live.”</p>

<p>Thyrza Beatup did not walk with the others. Her
grief was still too raw, and Mr. Sumption’s words about
Tom had made her cry. She carried Will under her
cloak, walking quickly over the wet ruts, home to the
fire before which she would undress him and put him
to bed. Mr. Sumption’s sermon had not had the same
effect on her as on the others—for one thing, she thought
of Tom more than of Jerry; for another, her feeling
towards the minister was of pure compassion. Poor
chap! how he must have suffered, how he must have
hated all those Who mourned honourably, who grieved
for heroes and saints, such as her Tom. What would
she have felt, she wondered, if Tom had died like
Jerry?...</p>

<p>She wished she could have seen Mr. Sumption after
the service, and asked him in to a bit of supper. Poor
soul! one could always comfort him through his inside.
She was glad Tom had been to see him on his last leave
... he had spoken very nicely of Tom.</p>

<p>She came to the little house, all blurred into the darkness,
with the rain scudding before it. A pale, blue light
hung under the clouds from the hidden moon, and was
faintly reflected in the gleaming wet of the roadway.
Thyrza fumbled for her key, and let herself into the
shop. The firelight leaped to meet her. As she turned
to shut the door, she saw a man go quickly past, head
sloped, shoulders hunched against the Wind.</p>


<h3>11</h3>

<p>Mr. Sumption felt he could not stay indoors—he could
not bear the thought of sitting long hours, harassed and
lonely, in that shabby, wind-thridden study of his, with

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>

the peeled wall-paper flapping in the draught and the
rain cracking on the windows. Besides, he would have
to face a personal encounter with Mrs. Hubble, and
weather the storm of her wrath at being “preached at”;
more than once she had thought fit to give him a piece of
her mind when the sermon had affronted her. The
tongue of a scolding woman was an anti-climax he dared
not face, so he let himself out of the little door at the
back of the chapel, and, turning up his collar, marched
away against the rain.</p>

<p>He had no exact idea where he was going. All he
knew was that he wanted to get away from Sunday
Street, from the people who had come to stare at him
in his trouble. A lump of rage rose in his throat and
choked him, and tears of rage burned at the back of his
eyes. He saw the rows of stolid faces, the greased heads,
the stupid bonnets. There they had sat and wagged
in judgment on him and his boy. There they had sat,
the people who were content to be suffered and died
for by the boys in Flanders, while they stayed at home
and grumbled. Well, thank the Lord he had told them
what they were! Ho! he had given it to them straight—he
had made their ears burn!</p>

<p>He walked on and on, cracking his joints with fury.
He had turned into the East Road at Pont’s Green, and
was now hurrying southward, head down, to meet the
gale. There was something in the flogging and whirling
of the wind which stimulated him; he found relief in
pushing against the storm, in swallowing the rain that
beat upon his lips and trickled down his face. He would
walk till he was tired, and then he would find some
sheltered place to go to sleep. Only through exhaustion
could he hope to find sleep to-night. It would be horrible
to lie and toss in stuffy sheets, while the darkness pressed
down his eyeballs and at last the dawn crept mocking

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>

round the window.... It did not matter if he stopped
out all night; he did not care what people thought of
him—he had burned his boats.</p>

<p>The moon was still pale under the clouds, and the wet
road gleamed like pewter. The hedges roared, as the
wind moved in them, and every now and then he could
hear the swish of a great tree, or the cracking and crying
of a wood. In the midst of all this tumult he felt very
lonely—if he passed a farm, with slats of lamplight under
its blinds, he felt more lonely still. But it was better
than the loneliness of a room, of the room to which someone
he loved would never come again. He had a sudden
memory of Jerry as he had seen him, the morning after
the boy’s own night out of doors, sitting like a monkey
in the big wash-tub in front of the fire....</p>

<p>It must have been between two and three o’clock in
the morning when Mr. Sumption found the road leading
past the gape of a big barn. By this time his legs were
aching with cold and wet, and his face felt all raw with
the sting of the rain. It would be good to take shelter
for a little while. Then he would go home, and brave
Mrs. Hubble. He would be back in his study when she
brought in his breakfast. Breakfast ... he rubbed his
big hands together, he was already beginning to feel
hungry. But before he went home he must rest. That
weariness which had muffled him like a cloak in the
chapel, fumbling his movements and veiling his eyes, was
dropping over him now. He felt the weight of it in his
limbs, and, worse still, in his heart and brain. When he
shut his eyes he saw nothing but rows of heads, staring
and wagging.... He went into the barn, and the sudden
stopping of the wind and rain made him feel dazed.
Then a queer thing happened—he pitched forward on his
face into a pile of straw, not giddy, not fainting, merely
fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>


<h3>12</h3>

<p>For some hours he slept heavily in his pitched, huddled
attitude, but as the cloud of sleep lightened before waking,
he had another dream of the old forge at Bethersden, and
of himself working there, in the days before the
“voices” came. He saw the great red glow of the
forge spread out over the cross-roads, fanning up the road
to Horsmonden and the road to Witsunden and the road
to Castweasel. He saw the smithy full of it, and himself
and his father working in it, with arms swung over the
glowing iron—he heard the roar of the furnace and the
thump of the hammers; and a great fulness of peace was
in his heart. Dimly conscious in his dream of all that
had passed since those happy days, he felt a wonderful
relief at being back in them, and the sweetest doubt as
to the reality of his later experiences.... So it had
been a dream, all his ministerial trouble and travail, his
brief snatch at love, his son’s birth in sorrow and life in
defiance and death in shame.... The hammers swung,
and the forge roared, and the light fanned up to the
stars....</p>

<p>Then he woke, with the roar and thump still in his
ears, for his head hung down over the straw below the
level of his body. All his limbs were cramped, and he
found it difficult to rise. The first despair of waking was
upon him, and he wished he could have died in his dream.
Bright sunshine was streaming into the barn, lighting up
its dark old corners where the cobwebs hung like lace.
Framed in the big doorway was a green hill freckled with
primroses and cuckoo flowers, with broom bushes budding
against a thick blue sky that seemed to drip with sunshine.</p>

<p>He stumbled out into the stroke of the wind, now
scarcely enough to ripple the big rain puddles that lay

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>

blue and glimmering in the road. He was in a part of
the country he did not know, doubtless beyond the frontiers
of the Four Roads, in some by-lane behind Rushlake
Green.</p>

<p>Though it was too late, he felt that even now he could
not go back to Sunday Street. He shrank from meeting
human beings, especially those who had sat before him in
rows like pea-pods last night. Oh, those heads! he would
never forget them, how they had stared and rolled....
He turned away from the road, and went up the rising
ground behind the barn. It was a spread of wild land,
some common now in its spring bloom of gorse and
violets. He threw himself down upon the turf, and for
a few minutes lay motionless, with the sun gently steaming
his damp crumpled clothes.</p>

<p>He longed to be back in his dream, back in the red
glow of the furnace, back at the old cross-roads in Kent.
A sense of great cruelty and injustice was upon him.
Why had the Lord called him from the work he loved,
away to unknown cares and sorrows, to a life for which
he was not fitted? It even seemed to him that if only
he had been left a blacksmith this tragedy of Jerry
would not have happened ... if Jerry had never been
in the impossible, grotesque situation of “a clergyman’s
son.”... Why had the Lord sent voices, which never
came now, which, indeed, had not come since his marriage?
Why had the Lord raised up the minister at Tenterden,
to send him to a training college and try to make
him what he never could be, a gentleman? He was no
minister—only a poor image of one, which everybody
laughed at. He had had qualms of doubts before this,
but he had put them from him; now he was too exhausted,
too badly bruised and beaten, to deceive himself
any further. He was no minister of God—he could
hardly, after a twelve years’ pastorate, scrape together a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>

congregation; people went anywhere but to the Particular
Baptists. They never asked for his ministrations at sick-beds,
they hardly ever came to him to be married or
buried, as if they doubted the efficacy of these rites at
his hands; he had not performed one baptism in the last
five years, and the only time his church has been full was
when they had all come to gaze on him, to see how he
bore his trouble. On the other hand, if a man had a sick
sheep or an ailing cow, or if his horse went lame or
spoiled his knees, he called him in at once. That ought to
have shown him. He was not a minister but a farrier,
and the people of Sunday Street knew it, and treated him
accordingly.</p>

<p>He lay with his face hidden against the grass. It
seemed as if his life had stopped like a watch, leaving
him, like a stopped watch, still in being. Jerry, the centre
and spring of his existence for twenty years, was gone;
his ministry was gone—he could not go back after what
had happened, and no brethren would call him elsewhere.
He could not stay on at Sunday Street or return to the
forge at Bethersden. Here he was, past middle age,
without friends, without kin, without livelihood, without
resources of any kind. He saw himself alone in a world
burning and crashing to ruin, a world that bristled with
the crosses of martyred boys and was black with the
dead hopes of their fathers.</p>

<p>A sob broke from him, but without tears. His being
seemed dried up. The horror of thick darkness was upon
him, of this blasted world rocking and staggering to the
pit, of the flame which devoured all, good and bad, elect
and damned, wheat and weeds. Who could endure to the
end of this Judgment? Who hoped to be saved? All
was burnt up, dried, and blasted. The day of the Lord
had come indeed and had consumed him like a dry stick.</p>

<p>“My soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh
unto the grave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am counted with them that go down into the pit.</p>

<p>“Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the
grave, whom Thou rememberest no more.</p>

<p>“Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in
the deeps.</p>

<p>“Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast vexed
me with thy waves.</p>

<p>“Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut
me off.</p>

<p>“Lover and friend hast thou put from me, and mine
acquaintance into darkness.”</p>

<p>His hands clenched on the young grass, slowly dragging
out bunches of tender, growing things. He began
to smell the sweetness of their roots, of the soil that
clung to them—moist, full of sap and growth, of inevitable
rebirth. These budding, springing things, growing
out of deadness into life and warmth, suddenly gave him
a little piteous thrill of joy, which broke into his despair
like a trickle of rain into dry sods. The earth seemed to
hold a steadfast hope in her stillness and strength, in her
scent and moisture and green life struggling out of death....
Those boys who had cast themselves down on the
earth to die, perhaps they had found this hope ...
perhaps disgraced Jerry slept with it. No man, no blood-lusty
power, could cheat them of it, for even bodies blown
into a thousand pieces the earth takes into her kind stillness
and makes them whole in union with herself.</p>

<p>Even in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, the earth
had not failed him. No one could separate him from her
or cheat him of his reward in her. From her he had come
and to her he would return, and in her he would be one
with those whom he had lost, his dead wife and his dead

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>

son. There should be no disgrace there, nor torment, nor
tears, nor sighing; no parting, when all are united in the
one element and the children are asleep together on the
mother’s breast....</p>


<h3>14</h3>

<p>An hour later Mr. Sumption had left the green hill and
was walking towards a little hamlet that showed its
gables at the bend of the lane. Now that his grief was
spent, drunk up by the earth like a storm, he remembered
that he was hungry, and set out to hunt for food. There
was an inn at the beginning of the street, a low house
slopped with yellow paint and swinging the sign of the
Star across the road. Mr. Sumption walked in and asked
the landlady for breakfast; then, upon her stare, changed
his demand to dinner, whereat she told him that the Star
did not give dinners, and that there was a war on. However,
he managed at last to persuade her to let him have
some dry bread and tea, and a quarter of an hour later
he was making the best of them in a little green, sunless
parlour, rather pleasantly stuffy with the ghosts of bygone
pipes and pots.</p>

<p>The room was in the front of the house, and the
shadow of the inn lay across the road, licking the bottom
of the walls of the houses opposite. Above it they rose
into a yellow glare of sunshine, and their roofs were
bitten against a heavy blue sky. From quite near came
the pleasant chink of iron, and craning his head he saw
the daubed colours of a smith and wheelwright on a door
a little further down the street. It comforted him to
think that there should be a smith so near him, and all
through his meal he listened to the clink and thud, with
sometimes the clatter of new-shod hoofs in the road.</p>

<p>When he had finished his dinner and paid his shilling
he went out and up beyond the shadow of the inn to the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>

smith’s door. The name of the hamlet was Lion’s Green,
and he gathered he was some ten miles from home, beyond
Horeham and Mystole. It would not take him more
than a couple of hours to get back with his great stride,
so there was time for him to linger and put off the evil
hour when he must confront Mrs. Hubble and explain
why he had been out all night. Meantime he would go
and watch the smith.</p>

<p>There was no house opposite the forge, and the doorway
was full of sunshine, which streamed into the red
glare of the furnace. Mr. Sumption stood in the mixing
light, a tall black figure, leaning against the doorpost.
He had smoothed his creased and grass-stained clothes
a little, and taken out the straws that had stuck in his
hair, but he always looked ill-shaved at the best of times,
and to-day his face was nearly swallowed up in his beard.
The smith was working single-hand, and had no time to
stare at his visitor. He wondered a little who he was, for
though he wore black clothes like a minister, he was in
other respects more like a tramp.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Mr. Sumption suddenly.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said the smith, hesitating whether
he should add “sir,” but deciding not to.</p>

<p>“You seem pretty busy.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I am—unaccountable busy. I’m aloan now—my
man went last week. Thought I wur saafe wud a
man of forty-eight, but now they raise the age limit to
fifty, and off he goes into the Veterinary Corps.”</p>

<p>“Shall I give you a hand?”</p>

<p>The smith stared.</p>

<p>“I’ve done a lot of smith’s work,” continued Mr.
Sumption eagerly. “There’s nothing I can’t do with hoof
and iron.”</p>

<p>The smith hesitated; then he saw the visitor’s arms as
he took off his coat and began to roll up his sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, maybe ... if you know aught ... there’s
the liddle cob thur wants a shoe.”</p>

<p>A few men and boys were in the smithy, and they
looked at each other and whispered a little. They had
never seen such swingeing, hairy arms as Mr. Sumption’s.</p>

<p>A smile was fighting its way across the stubble on the
minister’s face. He cracked his joints with satisfaction,
and soon the little cob was shod by as quick, as merciful,
and as sure a hand as had ever touched him. His owner
looked surprised.</p>

<p>“I’d never taake you fur a smith,” he remarked;
“leastways, not wud your coat on.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a smith. I’m a Minister of the Gospel.”</p>

<p>The men winked at each other and hid their mouths.
Then one of them asked suddenly:</p>

<p>“Are you the Rev. Mr. Sumption from Sunday
Street?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I am. Do you know me?”</p>

<p>“I doan’t know you, surelye; but we’ve all heard as
the minister of Sunday Street can shoe a horse wud any
smith, and postwoman wur saying this marnun as he’d
gone off nobody knows whur, after telling all his folk in
a sermon as they’d started the War.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“I only went for a bit of a tramp, and lost my way
... I’ve no call to be home before sundown—so, if
you’ve any use for me, master, I can stop and give you
a hand this afternoon.”</p>

<p>The smith was willing enough, for he was hard-pressed,
and the fame of the Reverend Mr. Sumption had spread
far beyond the country of the Four Roads. The strength
of his great arms, his resource, his knowledge, his experience
of all smithwork, made him an even more valuable
assistant than the man who had gone. There was
a market that day at Chiddingly, which meant more

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>

work than usual, including several wheelwright’s jobs,
which the smith performed himself, leaving the horses
to Mr. Sumption. The furnace roared as the bellows
gasped, and lit up all the sag-roofed forge, with the dark
shapes of men and horses standing round, and the minister
holding down the red-hot iron among the coals or
beating it on the anvil, while his sweating skin was shiny
and crimson in the glow.</p>

<p>It was like his dream of the forge at Bethersden—and
he felt almost happy. The glow of his body seemed to
reach his heart and warm it, and his head was no longer
full of doubts like stones. He had found a refuge here,
as he had found it in old days in Mus’ Bourner’s forge at
Sunday Street—the heat, the roar, the flying sparks, the
shaking crimson light, the smell of sweat and hoofs and
horse-hide, the pleasant ache of labour in his limbs, were
all part of the healing which had begun when he rubbed
his cheek against the wet soil on the common. His
religion had always taught him to look on his big friendly
body as his enemy, to subdue and thwart and ignore it.
He had not known till then how much it was his friend,
and that there is such a thing as the Redemption of the
Body, the mystic act through which the body saves and
redeems the soul.</p>

<p>He worked on till the sun grew pale, and a tremulous
primrose light crept over the fields of Lion’s Green,
swamping the trees and hedges and grazing cows. The
afternoon was passing into the evening, and Mr. Sumption
knew he must start at once if he was to be home
that day.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m middling sorry to lose you,” said the smith.
“A man lik you’s wasted preaching the Gospel.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I shan’t do much more of that,” said Mr.
Sumption wryly. “I can’t go back to my Bethel, after

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>

what’s happened.”</p>

<p>“Well, if ever you feel you’d lik to turn blacksmith
fur a change——” the smith remarked, with a grin.</p>

<p>“I shall go into the Army Veterinary Corps,” said
Mr. Sumption.</p>

<p>“Wot! Lik my man?”</p>

<p>“Like the man I was meant to be. I agree with you,
master—I’m wasted preaching the Gospel. I’d be better
as a veterinary ... I’ve been thinking....”</p>


<h3>15</h3>

<p>There was a farmer driving as far as Adam’s Hole on
the Hailsham Road, and he offered Mr. Sumption a lift
in his trap. The minister had shod his little sorrel mare,
and with her hoofs ringing on the clinkered road they
drove from Lion’s Green, away towards the east. The
dipping sun poured upon their backs, flooding the lane
and washing along their shadows ahead of them into the
swale. The east was still bright, and out of it crept the
moon, frail and papery, like the petal of a March flower.</p>

<p>The little mare spanked quickly over the way on her
new-shod hoofs. Through Soul Street and Horeham
Flat, by Badbrooks and Coarse Horn on the lip of the
Marsh rolled the trap, with the minister nearly silent and
the farmer talking about the War—till the oasts of
Adam’s Hole showed their red turrets against a wood,
and, declining an invitation to step in and hear half a
dozen more good reasons why the Germans would never
get the Channel Ports, Mr. Sumption tramped off to
where the East Road swung into the flats.</p>

<p>The sun was now low, and the sunk light touched the
moon, so that her smudged arc kindled and shone out of
the cold dimness. Red and yellow gleams wavered over
the country of the Four Roads, sweeping up the meadows
towards Three Cups Corner, and lighting the woods that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>

blotched the chimneys of Brownbread Street. He saw
Sunday Street slitting the hill with a red gape, and the
sheen of the ponds by Puddledock, and the flare of gorse
and broom on Magham Down. There was a great clearness
and cleanness in the watery air, so that he could see
the roofs of farmsteads far away and little cottages standing
alone like toadstools in the fields. Sounds came
clearly, too—there was a great clucking on all the farms,
and the lowing of cows; now and then the bark of a dog
came sharply from a great way off, sheep called their
lambs in the meadows by Harebeating, and a boy was
singing reedily at Cowlease Farm....</p>

<p>It was all very still, very lovely, steeped through with
the spirit of peace—not even the beat of the guns could
be heard to-night. These were the fields for which the
boys in France had died, the farms and lanes they had
sealed in the possession of their ancient peace by a covenant
signed in blood. As Mr. Sumption looked round
him at the country slowly sinking into the twilight, a
little of its quiet crept into his heart. These were the
fields for which the boys had died. They had not died for
England—what did they know of England and the British
Empire? They had died for a little corner of ground
which was England to them, and the sprinkling of poor
common folk who lived in it. Before their dying eyes
had risen not the vision of England’s glory, but just these
fields he looked on now, with the ponds, and the woods,
and the red roofs ... and the women and children and
old people who lived among them—the very same whom
last night he had scolded and cursed, told they were
scarce worth preaching at. For the first time he felt
ashamed of that affair. He might not think them worth
preaching at, but other men, and better men, had found
them worth dying for.</p>

<p>Then, as he walked on towards Pont’s Green, he saw

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>

these fields as the eternal possession of the boys who had
died—bought by their blood. The country of the Four
Roads was theirs for ever—they had won it; and this
was true not only of the honoured Tom but of the dishonoured
Jerry. For the first time he felt at rest about
his son. “Somewhere the love of God is holding him....”
He could not picture him in heaven, and he would
not picture him in hell; but now he could see him as part
of the fields that he, in his indirect shameful way, had
died for. Surely his gipsy soul could find rest in their
dawns and twilights, in the infinite calm of their noons....
Jerry would be near him at the pond side, in the
meadow, in the smoke of the forge, in the murmur and
shade of the wood ... and the cool winds blowing
from the sea would wipe off his dishonour.</p>


<h3>16</h3>

<p>The lanes were empty for it was supper-time on the
farms. A pale green was washing the rim of the sky,
and the starlight shook among the ash-trees that trembled
beside the road. Faint scents of hidden primroses stole
up from the banks with the vital sweetness of the new-sown
ploughlands. It was growing cold, and Mr. Sumption
walked briskly. When he came to Pont’s Green he
thought he saw the back of old Hubble tottering on ahead,
so he slackened his pace a little, for he hoped to get
home without meeting any of his congregation. The feeling
of shame was growing, he felt as if he had despised
Christ’s little ones ... after all, who shall be found
big enough to fit the times? What man is built to the
stature of Doomsday?</p>

<p>He heard himself called as he entered the village, and
turning his head, saw Thyrza standing in the shop door,
the last light gleaming on her apron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mus’ Sumption!—is that you?”</p>

<p>He thought of going on, pretending not to hear; but
there was a gentleness in Thyrza’s voice which touched
him. He remembered the message she had sent him yesterday
morning. “She’s a kind soul,” he thought, and
stopped.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mus’ Sumption—whur have you bin?”</p>

<p>Her hand closed warmly on his, and her eyes travelled
over him in eagerness and pity.</p>

<p>“I’ve been over to Lion’s Green,” said Mr. Sumption.
“I couldn’t lie quiet at the Horselunges last night. I
reckon tongues are wagging a bit.”</p>

<p>“Reckon they are—but we’ll all be justabout glad to
see you back. I went up only this afternoon and asked
Policeman if he cud do aught. Come in to the fire—you
look middling tired.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been working at the smith’s over at Lion’s Green
all the afternoon,” said the minister proudly.</p>

<p>“Surelye! Everyone knows wot a valiant smith you
maake; but come in and have a bite of supper. The
fire’s bright and the kettle’s boiling, and thur’s a bit of
bacon in the pan.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumption’s mouth watered. He had had nothing
that day except the bread and tea provided at the inn,
and it was not likely that Mrs. Hubble would have much
of a meal awaiting him. True, it was doubtful morality
to encroach on Thyrza’s bacon ration, but Thyrza herself
encouraged the lapse, pulling at his hand, and opening
the shop door behind her, so that his temptations
might be reinforced by the smell of cooking.</p>

<p>“Come in, and you shall have the best rasher you
ever ate in your life—and eggs and hot tea and a bit of
pudden and a fire to your feet.”</p>

<p>She led him through the shop, whence the bottles of
sweets had vanished long ago, and the empty spaces

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>

were filled with large cardboard posters, displaying
Thyrza’s licence to sell margarine, and the Government
list of prices—through into the little back room, where
the firelight covered the walls with nodding spindles, and
little Will lay in his cradle fast asleep.</p>

<p>“I have him in here fur company like,” said Thyrza.
“Reckon he sleeps as well as in the bed, and it aun’t so
lonesome fur me.”</p>

<p>For the first time he heard her sorrow drag at her
voice, and noticed, as, manlike, he had not done before,
her widow’s dress with its white collar and cuffs.</p>

<p>“God bless you, Mrs. Tom,” he said, and she turned
quickly away from him to the fire.</p>

<p>For some minutes there was silence, broken only by
the humming of the kettle and the hiss of fat in the pan.
Mr. Sumption lay back in an armchair, more tired than
he would care to own. The window was uncurtained, and
in the square of it he saw the big stars of the Wain ...
according to the lore both of the country of the Four
Roads and of his old home in Kent, this was the waggon
in which the souls of the dead rode over the sky, and
that night he, in spite of his theological training, and
Thyrza, in spite of her Board School education, both felt
an echo of the old superstition in their hearts. Did Tom
and Jerry ride there past the window, aloft and at rest
in the great spaces, while those who loved them struggled
on in the old fret and the new loneliness?</p>

<p>“I always kip the blind up till the last minnut,” said
Thyrza at the fire. “It aun’t so lonesome fur me. Howsumdever,
I’ve company to-night, and I mun git the
lamp.”</p>

<p>So the lamp was set on the table, and the blind came
down and shut out Tom and Jerry on their heavenly
ride. Mr. Sumption pulled his chair up to a big plate
of eggs and bacon, with a cup of tea beside it, and fell to

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>

after the shortest grace Thyrza had ever heard from him.</p>

<p>“Reckon I’m hungry, reckon I’m tired—and you, Mrs.
Tom, are as the widow of Zarephath, who ministered to
Elijah in the dearth. May you be rewarded and find your
bacon ration as the widow’s cruse this week.”</p>

<p>He was beginning definitely to enjoy her company.
Thyrza’s charm was of the comfortable, pervasive kind
that attracted all sorts of men in every station. He
found that he liked to listen to her soft, drawly voice,
to watch her slow, heavy movements, to gaze at her
tranquil face with the hair like flowering grass. She at
once soothed and stimulated him. She encouraged him
to talk, and when the edge was off his appetite, he did so,
telling her a little of what had happened to him the last
night and day.</p>

<p>“And what do you think I’ve learned by it all, Mrs.
Tom? What do you think my trouble’s taught me?”</p>

<p>Thyrza shook her head. In her simple life trouble
came and went without any lesson but its patient bearing.</p>

<p>“It’s taught me I’m a blacksmith, and no minister.”</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re both,” said Thyrza.</p>

<p>“No—I’m not—I’m just the smith. And to prove it
to you, from this day forward I shall not teach or preach
another word.”</p>

<p>“Wot! give up the Bethel!—not be minister here any
more?”</p>

<p>“Not here nor anywhere. I’m no minister—I’ve never
been a minister.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“There’s no good arguing. My mind’s made up. I
shall write to the Assembly this very night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh——”</p>

<p>“How shall I dare to teach and guide others, who
could not even teach and guide my own son? No, don’t
interrupt me—the Lord has opened my eyes, and I see
myself as just a poor, plain, ignorant man. Reckon I’m
only the common blacksmith I was born and bred, and
trying to make myself different has led to nothing but
pain and trouble, both for me and for others. I ask you
what good has my ministry ever done a human soul?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mus’ Sumption, doan’t spik lik that,” said
Thyrza, with the tears in her eyes. “Reckon I’ll never
disremember how beautiful you talked of Tom last night
... and oh, the comfort it guv me to hear you talk so!”</p>

<p>“You’re a good soul, Missus—reckon there’s none I
could speak to as I’m speaking to you now. But you
mustn’t think high of me—I spoke ill last night; I was
like Peter before the Lord let down the sheet on him—calling
His creatures common and unclean. I’ve failed
as a minister, and I’ve failed as a father—the only thing
I haven’t failed as is a blacksmith; thank the Lord I’ve
still some credit left at that.”</p>

<p>He hid his face for a moment. Thyrza felt confused
... she scarcely understood.</p>

<p>“Then wot ull you do, Mus’ Sumption, if you mean
to be minister no more?”</p>

<p>“Join the A.V.C.—Army Veterinary Corps. I see as
plain as daylight that’s my job.”</p>

<p>“Wot! Go and fight?”</p>

<p>“Reckon there won’t be much fighting for a chap of
my age. But I’ll be useful in my way. I hear they’re
short of farriers and smiths. Besides, they’re calling up
all fit men under fifty, and I can’t claim exemption as a
minister, seeing I ain’t one; and reckon Mr. Smith ull
go now Randall Cantuar and Charles John Chichester
have said he may.... So I’m off to Lewes to-morrow,
Mrs. Tom.”</p>

<p>“We shall miss you unaccountable. Besides, it aun’t
the life fur a man lik you.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “That’s just where you’re wrong—it’s

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>

the very proper life for a man like me, it’s the life I
should have been leading the last thirty years. Howsoever,
it’s not too late to mend, and reckon I’ll be glad
to have my part in the big job at last. Here’s thirty
years that I’ve been preaching the Day of the Lord, and
now’s my chance of helping that day through a bit.”</p>

<p>He stood up and pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, doan’t be going yit, Mus’ Sumption.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I must—I’ve all sorts of things to do. Don’t
be sorry for me—I’m doing the happiest thing I ever did
as well as the best. I’ll be doing the work I was born
for, and I’ll be helping the world through judgment, and
I’ll be doing what I owe my boy—your boy—all the boys
that are dead.”</p>

<p>Thyrza’s eyes filled with tears when he spoke of Tom.
For a moment he seemed to forget his surroundings,
and to fancy himself back in the pulpit he had renounced,
for he held up his hand and his voice came throatily:</p>

<p>“Behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven;
and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be
as stubble. But unto you that fear My name shall the
Sun of Righteousness arise with healing in His wings.
And He shall turn the heart of the fathers to their children,
and the heart of the children to their fathers....
Oh, Thyrza, the world is sown over with young, brave
lives, and it’s our job to see that they are not as the seed
scattered by the wayside, sown in vain. Reckon we must
water them with our tears and manure them with our
works, and so we shall quicken the harvest of Aceldama,
when our beloved shall rise again....”</p>

<p>His voice strangled a little; then he continued in his
ordinary tones:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s why I’m joining up. I owe it to Jerry—to
finish what he began. By working hard, and submitting
to orders, as he could never do, poor soul, maybe I’ll be
able to clear off the debt he owed. He shall rise again
in his father’s effort....”</p>

<p>Thyrza was crying now. “And Tom?” she asked in
her tears—“I want to do summat for him, too, Mus’
Sumption. How shall Tom rise up agaun?”</p>

<p>He pointed to the cradle at her feet:</p>

<p>“There’s your Tom—risen again both for you and for
his country. Take him and be comforted.”</p>

<p>She sank down on her knees beside the cradle, hiding
her face under the hood, and he turned and left her, stalking
out through the shop into the darkness.</p>

<p>Crouching there in the firelight, with her baby held
warm and heavy against her breast, she heard his tread
grow fainter and fainter, till at last only an occasional
throb of wind brought her the footsteps of the lonely man
upon the road.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
